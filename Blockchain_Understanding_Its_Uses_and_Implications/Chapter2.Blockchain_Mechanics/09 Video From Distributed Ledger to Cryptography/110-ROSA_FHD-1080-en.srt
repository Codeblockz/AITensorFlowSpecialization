A great way to think of blockchain is to think of blockchain as another layer of  the Internet, a layer that enables secure and trusted records and transactions to occur,

1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,660
which is why a lot of people associate the word blockchain with the  word trust.

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,200
Blockchain creates a layer of trust between untrusted parties.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,300
Without blockchain to create trusted records and transactions, a third party intermediary is necessary.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:41,500
Blockchain eliminates the need for a centralized institution to act as intermediary, and instead uses cryptography and collaboration to create that trust.

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,280
In an earlier chapter of this course we spoke about collaboration through distributed ledgers.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:57,100
Now, we will be taking a further look at how cryptography is used in blockchain to create the second element necessary for blockchain to be a source of trust.

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,220
Information on the blockchain is stored on the ledger using cryptography.

8
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,740
It can be accessed using keys and cryptographic signatures.

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:13,620
Now, let's take a look into some of the key concepts of cryptography that are utilized with blockchain.
