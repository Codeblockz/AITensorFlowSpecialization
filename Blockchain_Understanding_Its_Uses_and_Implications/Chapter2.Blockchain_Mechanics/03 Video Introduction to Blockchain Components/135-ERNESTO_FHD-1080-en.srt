00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:11,500
In this section, we're going to discuss the core components of the blockchain, starting with a high-level view of the blockchain components.

1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,640
The first blockchain component that we're going to look at it's the ledger.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,020
However, before we discuss the ledger, let's discuss briefly the history of the ledger.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,060
The story of blockchain is tightly coupled with the story of accounting.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:35,440
Historically, humans started off with no way to prove ownership and we began with a single entry accounting system.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:43,180
The single entry accounting system for the first time in human history allowed us to prove ownership of the asset.

6
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,540
The ledger was associated with an owner.

7
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,460
The single entry accounting worked for centuries.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:01:02,960
The issue with single entry accounting is that it mandated that there was a single authority, which is the reason why there was the necessity for a king or a queen to control the ledger.

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:11,300
In order to have trade, right, at the international level, we needed to have at least two authorities.

10
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:26,760
So, for instance, for England to do trade with France, we had the owner of the ledger, the single entry ledger, in England for instance, doing trade with the king or queen of France, who also had their ledger.

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:39,040
And so, we needed a new form of accounting, and that's where double entry accounting came in, which was in use up until very recently, now, within the last 40 years.

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:51,680
What blockchain is? Blockchain is the very first implementation of triple entry accounting, where we have an asset being recorded on the ledger in the context of a transaction.

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:03,480
The third entry and triple entry accounting is cryptography, where we have a cryptographic account of the transaction stored permanently and immutably on the ledger.

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,580
That's what the ledger is. A ledger is a collection of transactions.

15
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:17,200
It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a transaction, but the ledger records the transaction.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,520
In blockchain, the differentiator is that no one owns the ledger, or all of the participants own the ledger.

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:37,300
The ledger is distributed. It is, in other words, it's decentralized. So, there's a copy of the ledger that exists on every node that exists on the network.

18
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,780
Said simply, the ledger is a distributed immutable record of a collection of transactions.

19
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,140
Bitcoin is the most popular asset.

20
00:02:49,140 --> 00:03:01,780
It was the first asset to be recorded as a transaction on a blockchain ledger, and it remains the most popular, at least in terms of market share.

21
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,940
That's what the ledger is.

22
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:17,360
As we move to more modern blockchains, we start to look at blockchains such as Ethereum, which not only records the asset on the blockchain,

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:31,340
Ethereum and other public blockchains like Ethereum, they also allow you to have a permanent and immutable collection of code, also known as a smart contract, that runs on the blockchain.

24
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:40,300
So, the ledger stores the assets, the transactions that are on the blockchain, and it also holds the code.

25
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,700
The code that's stored on the blockchain is a smart contract.

26
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,680
Again, a smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain.

27
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,600
The blockchain is a network.

28
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:59,680
The blockchain is a ... A public blockchain is equivalent to the Internet, complete with the its own set of protocols, etc.

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,960
Private blockchains are more synonymous with an intranet.

30
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:15,360
It is... just like we have a use case for public blockchains and public internet, we also have use cases for private blockchains and an intranet, if we're gonna stay with that analogy.

31
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:25,340
On each of these networks there are nodes. The nodes are going to be synonymous with the computers that make up the network.

32
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,040
On the nodes, they are put together by a collection of protocols.

33
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,000
Each blockchain has its own set of protocols that defines not only the nodes, but how those nodes communicate with each other.

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,840
So, when you hear the term "peer network", that's what we're talking about;

35
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,820
we're talking about how that blockchain is put together, what are the protocols that define the peers, and how those peers interact.

36
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:59,140
Those peer networks, they store the ledger, they provide the updates, they effectively, they maintain the ledger.

37
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,856
That's what a peer is on a peer network.

38
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:14,660
On a public blockchain, it's public, and, by definition, that means that anyone is allowed to join and participate in that public blockchain.

39
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,700
On the private blockchain, however, the situation is a little different.

40
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,420
On the private blockchain, we have to control who can access your network.

41
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Just like no company would allow... no company would allow anyone to access their private intranet,

42
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:40,200
in a private blockchain you have to be asked to join, or you have to have permission to join.

43
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,820
So, a membership service is a gateway that allows users and components to enter a private blockchain.

44
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:55,560
So, a membership service or a membership service provider provides the services of user authentication,

45
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:03,980
user authorization, component authentication, component authorization, more specifically Identity Management.

46
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,420
If we're talking about a private blockchain, then we have to control who the members are, and not only the members.

47
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,200
We have to also control the nodes that access the blockchain.

48
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:25,080
So, as we're talking about membership, one of the key components of membership is we have to allow certain users to access the blockchain.

49
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,520
In order to do that, we have to have a definitive identity for each user.

50
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,940
In the blockchain, that's achieved in two ways.

51
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:42,560
One, we use PKI, to provide a public key. And that public key represents the identity of the user.

52
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,060
But we also need a private key that each user can hold to prove their identity.

53
00:06:48,060 --> 00:07:01,760
That private key is stored in a wallet. And a wallet is a collection of the user credentials. It is effectively ... it encapsulates private keys.

54
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,080
Additionally, in the blockchain... blockchains are self-contained, or they should be self-contained.

55
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:18,100
And so, one of the key aspects for developing on a blockchain or using a blockchain is we have to have a way to interact with the blockchain.

56
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,368
And one of the ways that we do that is through events.

57
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:29,920
So, when something occurs on the blockchain, either public blockchains... most public blockchains anyway, and certainly all private blockchains,

58
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,720
they have events that are fired when certain key actions are triggered.

59
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:51,200
This allows end-users, other systems, other users, different components to be able to act off of the events that come from an update on a blockchain.
