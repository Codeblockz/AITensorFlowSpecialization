The concept of distributed ledge's has been around for hundreds of years.

1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,420
To understand the basics of blockchain, it's important to understand how distributed ledgers work.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:21,360
A distributed ledger is a collection of data with no central administrator that has been agreed upon by consensus.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:30,040
To understand more details, let's take a trip way back, back into 500 AD on the island of Yap.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,600
The Yapese people used a very unique form of currency: the Rai stone.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,940
Each of these stones weighed around 200 kilos, making them difficult to move.

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:52,240
To exchange them as money for goods or services, they divided the stones into sections and then, they would announce to every adult on the island who owned what part of each stone.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,680
Each adult had to keep a mental ledger of ownership.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,880
Every time any Yapese conducted a trade, an announcement was made to the entire tribe.

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,380
Each member of the tribe would then update their mental ledger.

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,500
In today's description, this would be called a distributed ledger.

11
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,120
All Rai stone ownership was known to everyone, and that knowledge was updated whenever a transaction was made.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,480
So why didn't just one member of the tribe keep track of the Rai stones?

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,660
What if that main recordkeeper was sick, unable to do their job, or was found to be dishonest?

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:37,880
If the only copy of the ledger was changed by any means, wealth would be lost or gained unfairly.

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,840
The Yapese knew their distributed ledger system safeguarded it from tampering.

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Since all the Yapese knew who owned what, it would be very difficult to fool everyone on the island.

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,115
Even if one tribe member moved away, the tribe still had multiple copies of their mental ledger.

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,820
In this regard, the ledger was fault tolerant and could not be easily changed, corrupted, or lost.

19
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,460
The tribe also decided that stones didn't have to be on the island to hold value.

20
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:18,760
One day, a stone fell into the ocean and the Yapese decided that this stone, even though it could not be seen, still held value and could still be traded.

21
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:31,509
This system of consensus by the majority of the adults on the island with no central administrator is one of the first examples of distributed ledger.
