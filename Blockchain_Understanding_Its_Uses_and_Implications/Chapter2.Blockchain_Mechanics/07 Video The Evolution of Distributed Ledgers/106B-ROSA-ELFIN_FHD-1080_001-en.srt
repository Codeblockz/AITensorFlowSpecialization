We've gone through history and seen how ledgers have evolved from stone tablets to double entry ledgers.

1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,880
We even took a look at the earliest known example of distributed ledgers.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,160
Now, let's discuss the evolution of the ledger in the modern world.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,760
Over the last few decades, ledgers have moved from the written form to the digital form, also known as computers and digitalized databases.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,140
This has allowed us to be interconnected - a truly global economy.

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,860
Today, this recordkeeping system is being revolutionized again,

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:47,040
going from the digital realm or centralized databases keeping track of transactions to information being stored across different locations across the globe.

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,700
This system of record, information across a global network, is what we call decentralized ledgers.

8
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:09,180
A decentralized ledger can be described as a ledger of any transactions or contracts supported by a decentralized network from across different locations and people, eliminating the need of a central authority.

9
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,700
When a recording is made, every participant is notified of that recording.

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,040
They now own an identical copy of the record of transactions, identical to every other node on that network.

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,080
Every piece of information on a blockchain can be traced back to the exact moment when it was created.

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,620
So, if an audit is necessary, information can be found and deemed reliable.

13
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:48,260
This allows blockchain to serve as a truly reliable storage of public records and transactions, and therefore eliminating the need for a centralized authority of database of records.

14
00:01:48,260 --> 00:02:00,980
Now that we understand the foundational principle of blockchains - distributed ledgers, it's important to understand another important key element that makes blockchain so revolutionary: trust.

15
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:12,040
Trust is created through two key principles: collaboration and cryptography, both of which will be discussed shortly.
