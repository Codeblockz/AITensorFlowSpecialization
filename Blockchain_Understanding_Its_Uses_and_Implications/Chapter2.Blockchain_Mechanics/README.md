# Chapter 2. Blockchain Mechanics

## Introduction

1. Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will discuss distributed ledger technology, some of its basic components and how it differs from previous ledger storage techniques. We will gain an understanding of how previous computer technologies like file sharing, data storage and cryptography are wrapped into the blockchain foundations. We will also see how hashing functions and Merkle tree data structures help us immutably store and prove facts without revealing all the details.

Next, we will learn how these blockchain techniques are fundamental in public-key cryptography where key pairs support privacy and authenticity by only exposing the public key while keeping the private key secure. We will examine how this agreed-upon, append-only distributed ledger guarantees transparency and immutability, where trust in the information contained in the ledger is a given.

2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Discuss how cryptography allows for distributed ledgers to work on a global scale.
- Explain how blockchain is using cryptography.
- Define key terms of cryptography and understand basic concepts.
- Explain the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Merkle trees and how they are used in blockchain technologies.
- Discuss how blockchain utilizes transparency.
- Explain what it means for blockchains to be immutable and how chaining provides this capability.

8. Decentralized Ledger
   - As we can see by looking at the evolution of the ledger, we are entering a new phase where no one centralized authority has control of the details in the ledger, everyone does. Transactions are only added to the ledger if everyone agrees. Once consensus is reached, no one can go back and deny a transaction. So essentially you are not trusting one person or entity to control the ledger, you're trusting everyone. Let's look a little further into how that trust is achieved.


## Cryptography

9. Video: From Distributed Ledger to Cryptography
   - A great way to think of blockchain is to think of blockchain as another layer of the Internet, a layer that enables secure and trusted records and transactions to occur, which is why a lot of people associate the word blockchain with the word trust. Blockchain creates a layer of trust between untrusted parties.

    - cryptography
    - while blockchain itself may be new and cutting-edge, it's built out of nothing more than very old tried-and-true technology.
    - we're just combining old technology in new and creative ways to create a brand new solutions development platform.
