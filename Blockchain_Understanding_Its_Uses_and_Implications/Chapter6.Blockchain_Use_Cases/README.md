# A. Introduction

## 1. Chapter Overview

This final section will examine blockchains in action. We will see how blockchain is providing solutions for businesses, governments and social projects. Businesses fueled by blockchain solutions are developing new relationships for more efficient communication and trust among untrusting parties, fostering new business models.

- Governments
- 
Governments are realizing the best way to serve the population is to develop digital identity management systems where individuals hold their credentials and services can instantly be matched to those in need. We will discuss how governments are using blockchain to tackle document and workflow management issues creating better services for their citizens.

- developing countries


Next, we will discuss the impact blockchain is having in developing countries. We will look at examples of how philanthropy is offering new transparency and accountability to charity organizations with massive global benefits.

- new technologies and emerging breakthroughs 


Then, we will devote some time discussing new technologies and emerging breakthroughs developers are building. Either to enhance existing systems or offering services to help users manage blockchains, these new advances are like nothing we have seen before.

- individual's experience


Finally, we will see use cases designed to improve the individual's experience, decentralized gaming platforms and new marketplaces inventing new worlds to interact in. Blockchains are reshaping the way artists and musicians are benefiting from their creativity by having the royalties delivered directly to them, without agents and middlemen.

**Blockchain will be a part of everyone's future.**


## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Discuss blockchain use cases in business enterprises.
- Discuss use cases in the public sector.
- Explain the relevance of blockchain in social impact projects.
- Discuss developing new technologies made possible by blockchain.
- Explain how blockchain will improve the human experience.

# B. Blockchain in Practice
## 3. Blockchain Use Case Categories

Blockchain technology promises sound extremely lofty. Let's take a look at how this technology is improving the way we trust each other and interact. It is showing a new path that will improve the lives of so many. 


We will see how identity management is key (no pun intended) to all the use cases we discuss. For our discussion, we will categorize use cases by who is developing solutions, starting with large enterprise solutions to smartphone and web browser applications powered by blockchain that put control back in the user's hands:

-  Enterprise solutions
   -  Businesses and organizations are implementing blockchain to overcome obstacles in transparency and trust forging new associations with global implications.
-  Public sector solutions
   -  Governments are using blockchain solutions to improve services that they provide to their citizens. Digital identity solutions, central bank digital currencies and transparent workflows are bringing efficiency to the public sector system with an end result that benefits citizens. With that, new laws are needed to regulate this technology.
-  Social impact solutions
   -  Social impact blockchain solutions address social and environmental challenges. Backed by the [17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) blockchain developers, investors, philanthropists, government agencies and foundations are developing solutions that tackle these global problems.
-  Platform developers' solutions
   -  Blockchain is a new technology constantly improving and changing. Developers are creating standards and new platforms to bring this technology into the mainstream.
-  End user solutions
   -  Everyday solutions emerge that put decentralized blockchains and all the benefits they promise in the hands of individuals from new decentralized marketplaces to new ways to express your music, art, and even let you trade property built inside a game.

# C. Enterprise Solutions

## 4. Enterprise Solutions Overview

Businesses fueled by blockchain solutions are developing new relationships for more efficient communication and workflows, fostering new business models. Problems with how we transact online, to the cost of doing business, are solved with blockchain. Let’s look at an enterprise supply chain solution built with blockchain.

### 5. Global Supply Chains

Supply chain data is not always visible or trusted. In recent times of disruption supply chains matter more than ever. Global supply chain and blockchain are working to secure systems to better handle these disruptions. The Covid pandemic shed light on the frailty of our supply chains which accelerated discussion over blockchain solutions.

## 7. Farm to Table - Walmart

Farms are complicated ecosystems with many moving parts, careful timing, and seasonal financing structures. However, after the food leaves a farm, it becomes part of a wide-reaching supply chain with a lot of parties. Buyers, sellers, distributors, and grocery chains all want to know where the food is along its journey. You also probably want to know where your food has been before you serve it on your dinner table.

The trend toward blockchain agriculture promises to make each step of growing and distributing food simpler. It will offer all parties involved a single source of truth for the agriculture supply chain.
