# A. Introduction

## 1. Chapter Overview

Now that we understand the basics of how blockchain works, Chapter 5 will discuss **the problems blockchain can solve**. We will discuss the concept of immutability and how the append only blockchain brings new trust in shared information. Next, we will take what we learned about smart contracts to see how they are bringing autonomy to systems that previously required human interaction. We will discuss the double-spend issue and how blockchain can solve for it. We will also discuss some popular cryptocurrencies.

Next, we will discuss the **new business trends** blockchain makes possible. First, we will discuss the way we manage our identity and information on the Internet and how decentralized identity solutions rooted on a blockchain are fixing what is broken. Next, we will discuss how blockchain is revolutionizing the financial markets by autonomous market solutions that remove middlemen and open markets up to previously excluded clients. We will also join in the conversation around Central Bank Digital currencies and how enacting blockchain solutions can streamline the government's monetary policies.

Finally, we will discuss the energized world of NFT’s (non-fungible tokens) and how owning unique rights to everything from music, sports collectables and even “captured moments” is turning the collectable world upside down. We end the chapter with a brief discussion on interoperability. In order for this new technology to take hold, blockchains need to be able to communicate and transfer value amongst themselves.
