- [] A private blockchain is not distributed
 
- [x] A private blockchain requires the identity of users to be known
 
- [x] A private blockchain is more efficient and has faster transaction times
 
- [] A private blockchain does not need consensus

4.
How is a public blockchain "trustless"?

Blockchains assume that no node is to be trusted and every transaction is invalid until proven and verified by consensus

5.
Which of the following is not a consensus algorithm?

Byzantine Fault Tolerance
 
Proof of Work
 
Proof of Stake
 
x Proof of SunBurn

6.
Which of the following is not a key component of cryptography?

Secret
 
Key
 
Cipher
 
x Censorship
 
Function

7.
Which of the following are practical use cases for blockchain? Select all answers that apply.

x Voting

A video sharing website
 
x Medical records


x Identity management


8.
Bitcoin is the same thing as blockchain. False

9.
What is a block header?

The hash of the previous block
 
The hash of every transaction in a specific block
 
x The hash of the merkle root and the header of the previous block

10.
Which advantages does the Proof of Stake consensus provide over the Proof of Work consensus? Select all answers that apply.

x Higher transaction speed
 
x Lower electricity costs
 
Higher security
 
Compatibility with newer technology

11.
Blockchain is an example of single, double, triple, or infinite entry accounting?

triple

12.
Blockchain is always a better alternative to a standard database. False

13.
If a node on the network were to lose a copy of the ledger, the ledger is not lost. The millions of other nodes have a copy and won't lose track. This is what is known as ____________.

Immutability
 
x Fault tolerance
 
Censorship

14.
Which hashing algorithm does bitcoin currently use in the consensus process?

Ethash
 
Asics
 
x SHA-256


15.
How is ownership of a digital asset shown on the blockchain?


Digital assets are added and subtracted from your account according to the transaction
 
x Ownership is kept by referencing previous transactions where the address has received a digital asset
 
No one owns the digital assets on a distributed ledger


16.
How do consensus algorithms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake incentivize miners to participate?

x By paying the miners with cryptocurrency
 
By letting users use the platform without monthly subscription costs
 
By providing an immmutable, trustless, fault tolerant, and completely distributed ledger


17.
Which type of blockchain is Ethereum? Public, Open


18.
Who governs a blockchain?

The creator of the blockchain
 
x The users
 
The developers
 
The architects


19. 
A major change to blockchain protocol that makes it incompatible with old clients is called __________.

Nothing at stake problem
 
x Hard fork
 
Byzantine generals' problem

20.
What happens if a block is confirmed at the same time?

x The blocks split into two chains, blocks are then added to each chain, until one chain becomes larger. The longest chain is then considered to be the blockchain
 
Nodes select which block to be added to the blockchain
 
Both chains are deleted and the unconfirmed transactions are added back to the pool
