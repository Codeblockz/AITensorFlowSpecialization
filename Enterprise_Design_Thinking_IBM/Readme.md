## The Loop

Understand the present and envision the future in a continuous cycle of observing, reflecting, and making.

- Observe
  - Immerse yourself in the real world with design research. Interview users, watch them work, and test your ideas with the people who matter most to inform your decision-making and understanding.
- Reflect
  - Come together and look within to synchronize your movements, synthesize what you’ve learned, and share your “aha” moments with each other. Decide together and move forward with confidence.
- Make
  - Give concrete form to abstract ideas. The earlier you make the faster you learn. Put your ideas out there before they’re complete and improve them as you go.

## The Keys
Scalable practices for enterprise team alignment

- Hills
  - Align your team around the meaningful user outcomes you want to achieve. Hills are statements of intent written as user enablements. They follow a format of Who, What, and Wow.
    - Who: Who is your user? Refer to them by name.
    - What: What will your user be able to do that they couldn’t before? Start with a verb and avoid solutions.
    - Wow: What differentiates you from the competition? This is measurable.
- Playbacks
  - Stay aligned by regularly exchanging feedback. Playbacks are story-based presentations that share insights, ideas, and updates to a user experience.
- Sponsor Users
  - Invite users into the work and stay true to real-world needs. Sponsor Users are external clients, future clients, or end users that represent your target user, who regularly contribute domain expertise to your team. Relationships with Sponsor Users are typically formalized with an agreement that covers confidentiality and our right to use their feedback.

# 2 What is important - A focus on user outcomes

## 1. Identify your users and their problems
When you focus your team and your work around your users and their needs, you’re able to more easily decide what’s important. This makes your offerings more essential to the people who use them. If all you did was ask:

- Who are our users?

- What is their current experience?

- How could it be improved?

over and over again, you would get closer and closer to understanding your users and creating an ideal future for them. This allows you to put a more valuable offering into your client’s hands and into the market.

## Business problems to human-centered problems

## 2. Recongnize your assumptions
Get first hand data, feelings about your users

Observe to learn more
- Dig deeper than a requirement list. Remember: We’re not here to design a “vase.” We’re here to understand someone’s wants and needs, worries and goals, contexts and constraints. Building empathy for users and uncovering their needs will always get you much closer to solving business problems than blindly improving your product or service.
