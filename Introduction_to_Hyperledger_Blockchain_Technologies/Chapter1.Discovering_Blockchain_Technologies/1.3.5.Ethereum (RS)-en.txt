Can you give another example of a production blockchain system, such as Ethereum, and how is it different from Bitcoin?
Sure. Ehereum also has a public blockchain. It also groups and orders transactions into blocks.
However, Ethereum may be defined as an open source platform that enables  developers to build and deploy both smart contracts and decentralized applications, also known as Dapps.
In addition to the Ethereum public blockchain, there are numerous versions of Ethereum which are designed to be private and are permissioned.
