00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,780
And so, why were Bitcoin and Ethereum created? What problems do they solve?

1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,740
So, Bitcoin was first launched in January of 2009, as a response to the global financial crisis at the time.

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:25,060
Part of the motivation for the system was to be able to transfer value over the internet, without an intermediary.

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,440
So, one of the biggest inventions and problems that it solved was that of the &#39;double spend&#39; problem.

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,660
So, Bitcoin, in fact, is programmable money.

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,629
Ethereum, on the other hand, was created as a response to Bitcoin.

6
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:47,560
While Bitcoin is focused upon transferring monetary value between parties, it has a very limited programming language.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:57,400
Ethereum, on the other hand, uses a more expansive set of programming languages and tools to allow for many other types of programs and applications.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,940
The core invention of Ethereum is it&#39;s EVM, or Ethereum Virtual Machine.

9
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,300
The EVM runs on the Ethereum network, and it runs a Turing-complete software.

10
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,500
So, Vitalik Buterin is the person who wrote the white paper for Ethereum.

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,740
Some of its key features include the immutability of data, that unauthorized users cannot make changes to that data,

12
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,960
the Ethereum development platform is designed to make corruption and tamper proof applications,

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,000
the secure apps are sent decentralized and secured with cryptography,

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,300
and they&#39;re protected against hacking attacks and fraudulent activities,

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,660
and lastly, it&#39;s designed with zero downtime.

16
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,960
That is because the applications on the network are decentralized, and on many, many machines,

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:58,800
if some of those machines go down, the Ethereum network maintains a stable state of the Ethereum network.
