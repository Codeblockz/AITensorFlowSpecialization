00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,660
So, what is blockchain?

1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,660
As the Security Maven at Hyperledger, I have somewhat of a different perspective on what a blockchain is.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,380
I&#39;m a developer, primarily, and I look at the world in an adversarial way.

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,560
It&#39;s usually my software versus the world kind of thing.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:34,800
Blockchains, to me, definitely open up the world of possibilities for solving problems that have plagued us for many years.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:44,240
It breaks down to being able to create distributed consensus between mutually  distrustful parties, in many ways.

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,520
It also allows us to create an instantaneous single source of truth.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:58,020
In the past, we&#39;ve always had problems with trying to figure out what really happened over the course of a day.

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,940
Banks reconcile their books, inventory systems clear sales and deliveries...

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:13,700
With blockchains, we&#39;re recording things in real time, and it provides us with sort of an up-to-date accounting of the state of the world.

10
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:23,430
So, a lot of these old systems are going away, a lot of the work load management systems are going away. We&#39;re not doing batch processing at night anymore.

11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,920
Instead, we&#39;re doing validation in real time, and we always know the state of the world.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,680
This opens up a whole new host of applications that can be based around...

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:48,940
If we knew exactly where every bolt was, could we make sure that there are always  bolts at the place where they&#39;re going to be installed two minutes before they are needed... things like that...

14
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,160
So, like lean manufacturing is one case...

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:07,580
But, it also applies to every other process in the world where we have to track materials and effort, and money, things like that.

16
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,980
Let me think...

17
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:22,140
So, the blockchain, for me, actually is just sort of rethinking of our existing business processes around how we can be more effective when we know the state of the world as it is right now,

18
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:30,820
and we know it in two minutes, and we know it in two hours, rather than having to wait until the end of the day for everything to be reconciled.

19
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,240
This is actually a transition from human scale to computer scale.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:44,500
This was... all of these processes were done on a daily basis, and things like that,

21
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,100
and with blockchain, we&#39;re now... we&#39;re doing it instantaneous, because computers have made it that way.

22
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,160
From a security perspective, blockchains are not a silver bullet.

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,300
They&#39;re not going to replace the existing business logic.

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,840
They&#39;re more of a log-based system, so recording what has happened, as it is happening,

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,880
rather than being the source of what to do with money from a customer, and things like that.

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,200
It&#39;s not business process type of software.

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Because it is a log, and because it is the source of truth, and because a lot of other business logic will be based upon it,

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:37,420
the security concerns on it, related to blockchain, are roughly the same as existing business practices, or business logic.

29
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,790
You have to think of all the members of a distributed ledger as participating in a closed network,

30
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,600
because that&#39;s what they are, at least in permissioned networks,

31
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,660
we&#39;re not operating on the public Internet, we&#39;re not operating in a trustless environment.

32
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,400
It&#39;s the exact opposite. We... all the participants in the distributed ledger are known, they&#39;re permissioned,

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,340
that&#39;s where that term comes from, and they all participate as if they are in a private network.

34
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,000
So, when deploying blockchain software, it&#39;s typically done behind a firewall,

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,800
and, anytime you have multiple organizations participating in the distributed ledger,

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:26,940
we will use tunneling technology and other VPN firewall tricks to make a virtual LAN exist,

37
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,820
so that all of their organizations can talk over it.

38
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,280
Different Hyperledger projects have different trade-offs.

39
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,560
Fabric, for instance, has a more centralized ordering service,

40
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,120
and so, it makes more sense to organize one of those networks into a hub-and-spoke model,

41
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:54,120
where each peer connects to the ordering service, which is run either on one of the nodes, or on a neutral third party,

42
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:02,980
and all of the gossip messages that do the consensus mechanism go through a central hub.

43
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,920
Now, that sounds counterintuitive because just distributed ledgers are supposed to be distributed...

44
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,300
they still are, they&#39;re distributed in the sense that the blockchain itself is replicated amongst all of the nodes,

45
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,640
and so, your data is much more resilient to disruption...  resilient against disruption.

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,200
But, the coordination can still be done in a fairly centralized manner.

47
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,340
With Sawtooth, it is not so much the case, right?

48
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,620
The organization of the network for Sawtooth is probably more of like a star model,

49
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:47,640
where you pick some subset of nodes, and your node connects to those and, as long as all nodes are fairly well connected,

50
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,720
they can all eventually talk to each other, either one hop, or two hops, or three hops away, depending on the size of your network.

51
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,300
With Iroha, they... their topology is a lot different than the others,

52
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,520
because they designed their distributed ledger to function well in a mobile environment,

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,480
where a lot of the clients are intermittently connected.

54
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,060
So, they&#39;re mobile phones that can be connected and disconnected at random.

55
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:23,040
So, their structure is more of a layered network, where the end clients&#39; mobile  phones submit transactions to servers,

56
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,520
which then, amongst the servers, do the distributed ledger.

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,960
And there&#39;s no right answer, right?

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,280
The business process dictates which one you choose, but the security is pretty much the same in all of these.

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,760
We use cryptography and digital signatures to validate all the messages.

60
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,400
So, tampering with messages is essentially impossible.

61
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,540
The immutability of the distributed ledger is guaranteed by the cryptography,

62
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:02,060
but the nature of the trusted network, of the permissioned network, means that we have to treat it like any other back-office service.

63
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:11,000
You want to deploy it behind a firewall, you want to use tunneling to connect between nodes across the Internet,

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,440
and you want to maintain it, just like any other service that deals with Internet traffic...

65
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,280
you have firewalls, and load balancers, and things like that.

66
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,300
That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say about security. And thanks for taking our course.
