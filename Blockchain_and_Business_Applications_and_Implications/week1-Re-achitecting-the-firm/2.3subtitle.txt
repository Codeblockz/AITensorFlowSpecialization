Tell us a little bit about what consensus does in
the blockchain space? So consensus is
really interesting, and really epitomizes what it means to be
a blockchain company. So we both have
the foundational technology, contributing at the
protocol level to ethereum. Also core components,
and developer tools, so that we can build
with that technology, applications for
different purposes. The two sides of that equation
are for enterprises and that's working with
institutions and governments. Also ventures which are really more blockchain
native businesses, across all types of use cases. So it can be for music
all the way through to develop a workforce, and almost like an up work
on the blockchain.
