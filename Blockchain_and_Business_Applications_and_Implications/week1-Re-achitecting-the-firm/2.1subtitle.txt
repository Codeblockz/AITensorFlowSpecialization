Welcome to this module on
Redesigning the Corporation, which is a pillar of
modern capitalism, modest little topic today. Prepare to expand
the boundaries of the enterprise and the way
we think about firms. In this module, we'll explore blockchains role in
decentralizing organizations, and we'll be able to re-engineer the deep structures of
the firm with blockchain, a global platform for identity management and
peer-to-peer transactions. We believe Blockchain
technology will change how companies do business, and this will pave the way for greater innovation and
shared value creation. By the end of this module, you'll be able to explain how blockchain makes
decentralization possible. We'll look at consensus systems, a blockchain studios,
Software Development Studio. It has no rigid hierarchies, and instead it has a model of openness, collaboration,
and agility. Next, you'll be able to identify four types of transaction
costs to business. Those are search costs,
negotiation, contracting costs, coordination costs, and the costs of
enforcing agreements, over all the costs
of creating trust. You'll be able to explain how blockchain reduces these costs. You'll be able to
identify three ways blockchain search differs
from Internet search. Blockchain technology
preserves user privacy, and that's the dimension of time, and it results in information
which is of greater value. Last, you'll be able to list
some factors firms should consider when defining
their corporate boundaries. Blockchain won't replace the need for corporate structures, but infusing blockchain
principles into corporate culture can
help companies decide how and when to use outside partners for increasing
productivity and innovation.
