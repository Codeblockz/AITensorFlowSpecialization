# Week 1 Re-achitecting the firm

The corporation represents a pillar of modern capitalism. With the rise of a global peer-to-peer platform for identity, trust, reputation, and transactions, we will be able to re-engineer deep structures of the firm for innovation and shared value creation. In this module, we explore blockchainâ€™s role in decentralizing the enterprise and its implications on the roles and boundaries of the firm.

Learning Objectives
- Explain how blockchain enables the decentralization of the enterprise
- Identify four kinds of transaction costs of a firm and explain how blockchain reduces these costs
- Describe three ways that blockchain search differs from Internet search
- Describe some of the factors that firms should consider when defining their corporate boundaries

# 1 Course Introduction

## 1.1 Course Introduction

The enterprise of the future 
- more like a group of networks.  
- networks of organizations, individuals, and autonomous agents connecting via smart contracts to deliver all the value of today's big centralized behemoths.

In this course, you'll learn 
- how blockchain technology will penetrate into the structures of organizations encouraging innovation
- how blockchain enables decentralization of value creation, and of the enterprise
- understand 4 kinds of transaction costs of a firm
- explain how blockchain reduces each kind of cost
- how blockchain search differs from Internet search
- the factors business leaders should consider when to finding their corporate boundaries.

- define 4 types of blockchain organizations:
  - Distributed Application (DApp)
  - Autonomous Agent
  - Open Networked Enterprise
  - Distribued Autonomous Enterprise 


- 7 new business models
  - and how blockchain technology could enhance these models.
- how to find new ways to manage and protect intellectual (IP) property on a blockchain
- how blockchain will transform the rules of the C-suite executives
- difference between regulation and governance of blockchain, and the challenges of regulating in this new environment.
- identify the different layers of the blockchain technology stack, and how these layers help or hinder the governance of blockchain systems.
- 10 types of governance networks
- 7 qualities that a region and the world needs to attract technology startups and build a vibrant ecosystem

## 1.2 Instructor Introduction

CEOs  and government leaders  asked big questions:
- How will this technology transform specific industries? 
- What are the real challenges facing blockchain development today? 
- How can we overcome those challenges? 
- How will block chain change the nature of the enterprise, the way we manage our companies? 
- What will it mean for government architecture and the creation of services of public value? 
- How could this technology help us solve some big problems such as climate change? 

Big Ideas
- 1. Cryptoassets
  -  largest transformation of assets in human history, from an analogue to a digital media. 
     -  Bitcoin is but only one type of digital asset
  - 7 types of cryptoassets,  
    - that we can create, record, and trade on the blockchain.
- 2. Self-sovereign identity
  - our own digital identities
    - can't be given or taken away by any central administrator.
- 3. Smart contracts
  -  It's a means of codifying the terms of a deal in software.
  -  Smart contracts ensure contractual compliance, they hold parties accountable.
- 4. Decentralized business models
  - These are business models distributed across a blockchain network, not centralized in a traditional corporation. 
  - They can be fully autonomous too, meaning, no humans involved. 
    - There's big potential for true peer-to-peer models like ride-sharing without Uber as a middleman taking fees. 
    - Owners of driverless cars will someday be able to put their autonomous vehicles to work. 
- 5. The Ledger of Things
  - Future, most transactions will happen between devices and not between peopl
    - smart home
      - Home owners were adding smart devices such as thermostats and solar panels, and soon potentially trillions of devices will be connected to the Internet. Doing everything from driving us around to keeping our house lit, to managing our affairs, and managing our health information. These devices need to be resistant to hacking. They need to be able to communicate value such as money or assets like electricity peer-to-peer.
    - electricity
      - your neighbor's home is generating energy from a solar panel and you've got a device that needs to buy that electricity, then those two devices need a way to be able to contract, bargain, and execute a payment peer-to-peer. It's not going to happen through the Visa network, it can only happen on the blockchain.

***Technology alone doesn't solve problems, people do. It doesn't create prosperity, people do.***

# 2. Decentralizing the Enterprise

## 2.1 Module 1/Week 1 Overview - Re-design the corporation

You will learn
- blockchains role in decentralizing organizations,
- re-engineer the deep structures of the firm with blockchain
  - a global platform for identity management and peer-to-peer transactions
- change how companies do business, and this will pave the way for greater innovation and shared value creation

You will be able
- how blockchain makes decentralization possible. 
  - consensus systems
- identify 4 types of transaction costs to business.
  - over all the costs of creating trust
    - search costs, 
    - negotiation, contracting costs, 
    - coordination costs, and 
    - the costs of enforcing agreements
- explain how blockchain reduces these costs
- identify 3 ways blockchain search differs from Internet search.
- list some factors firms should consider when defining their corporate boundaries
  - Blockchain won't replace the need for corporate structures, but **infusing** blockchain principles into corporate culture can help companies decide how and when to use outside partners for increasing productivity and innovation.

## 2.2 Decentralizing the Enterprise

Ethereum and the company ConsenSys 
- ConsenSys works really more like a blockchain platform itself than a traditional corporation. 
- Blockhain challenges those top-down structures. 
  - co-founder, Joseph Lubin told us, "Global human society can now agree on the truth and make decisions in 10 minutes or even 10 seconds."
- ConsenSys is a blockchain-based company or blockcom as opposed to what we call a .com. 
  - A blockcom is a company formed and functioning on blockchain technologies. The company runs on Ethereum really as much as possible.
  - This includes funding, day-to-day tasks and projects, as well as software development and testing. That also includes hiring, it uses reputation systems where members can rate one another as collaborators. Boundaries are blurred in this new model.
