So we think governing bodies are particularly important because
the only way to create the trust that's needed in blockchain implementations is to have standard bodies
that are open, and that have a large group of participants that
establish those standards. The Blockchain In
Transportation Alliance or BITA is a critically
important one. We currently have a team member
at FedEx who chairs BITA, and we share many of
the committees that exist in BITA that are establishing
those technical standards, and the business standards associated with
what supply chain, blockchains should represent;
how they'll represent them. It's critically
important that you have those kinds of standards
and agreement in place if you want large communities to
participate because, as things get gray
around the edge, the trust gets broken. So we're very much believers in the fact that if we can put clear and concise standards out there that businesses
can participate in, all the way from
the Internet of Things interaction to business
interaction on a chain. We think that that's
what will make the technology scale and
be relevant globally.
