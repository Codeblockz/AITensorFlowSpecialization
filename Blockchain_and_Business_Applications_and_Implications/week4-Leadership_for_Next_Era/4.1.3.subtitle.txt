What do you see in terms
of the openness of governments and regulators
to blockchain solutions? Various regulators
and governments have taken different approaches
to blockchain. Some have been more open
and willing to learn, others have taken
a more conservative approach and not wanted to engage or
actually shutdown activities. I think like financial services
before blockchain, the governments
which are going to benefit most from the
technology will encourage it and see those
GDP benefits from technological
innovation and more of the world's global economy
running through technology, which is in that
jurisdiction, right? So some of the jurisdictions which have already benefited from blockchain have been
Switzerland and some of the smaller
islands nations who have faster-moving
legislative processes and wider open arms. I think of the larger
governments like the US and the UK and
the rest of the EU, they are now more welcoming to the technology after a lot of research
that they've put in. For example, the SCC has taken some positive stances
on this technology. I expect that to continue.
