Blockchain alone is just a tool. In order for this technology to fulfill its long-term promise, humans must lead. Rather than relying on state-based institutions, blockchain must be primarily self-governed through collaborations of civil society, private sector, government, and stakeholders in non-state networks. In this module, we discuss the idea of blockchain governance networks and explain how they can support blockchain stewardship at three levels: The platform level, the application level, and the ecosystem level. As well, you will learn about the conditions that are necessary for a blockchain-based hub of innovation to succeed.

# Learning Objectives

- Identify the different layers comprising the blockchain technology stack and describe how these layers enable or constrain the governance of a blockchain system
- Describe ten types of governance networks
- Identify seven conditions for success of a blockchain-based hub of innovation
