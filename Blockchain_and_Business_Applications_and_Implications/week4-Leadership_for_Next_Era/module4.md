Blockchain alone is just a tool. In order for this technology to fulfill its long-term promise, humans must lead. Rather than relying on state-based institutions, blockchain must be primarily self-governed through collaborations of civil society, private sector, government, and stakeholders in non-state networks. In this module, we discuss the idea of blockchain governance networks and explain how they can support blockchain stewardship at three levels: The platform level, the application level, and the ecosystem level. As well, you will learn about the conditions that are necessary for a blockchain-based hub of innovation to succeed.

# Learning Objectives
- Explain the difference between regulation and governance
- Discuss some of the key issues, challenges, trade-offs, and future scenarios related to blockchain and regulation
- Identify the different layers comprising the blockchain technology stack and describe how these layers enable or constrain the governance of a blockchain system
- Describe ten types of governance networks
- Identify seven conditions for success of a blockchain-based hub of innovation

# 4.1 Blockchain Regulation


## 4.1.1 Video: Module 4 Overview

- human lead
  - It's humans that build value, creating businesses and solve social problems. Technology doesn't do that. Humans need to lead for this technology to fulfill its long-term promise.
- self-governed
  - Blockchains must be self-governed through collaborations of civil society, private sector, governments and stakeholders in non-state networks or networks that are not controlled by nation states. 
  - State-based institutions can't lead through regulations alone. 
- difference 
  - between regulation and government 
  - and governance
- education people
  - Blockchain expertise lies with developers and users, not with government bureaucrats and regulatory bodies. 
  - So we need to educate the full field of stakeholders from governments to individuals, on the scope of this disruption and about the block chains ability to unleash capability across different sectors
- key issues, the trade offs and the scenarios related to blockchain and regulation
  - current regulations
    - some apply to blockchain use
    - most don't apply
      - there's no framework in place to fill the gap
  - regulation
    - how the regulation of the Internet of information was governed
    - how we might regulate and govern blockchain on a global scale
  - tech stack
    - different layers of the block chain technology stack that need governance
  - block chain governance networks
    - how they can support blockchain leadership and stewardship at three levels
      - platform level
      - application level
      - ecosystem level

## 4.1.2 Video: Intro to Blockchain Regulation

- at attempts to regulate the Internet previously and also financial markets
- It's still no simple task to regulate the Internet. It sits at the intersection of computing and communications, and it's global.
