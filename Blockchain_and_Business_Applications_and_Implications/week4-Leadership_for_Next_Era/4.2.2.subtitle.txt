The European Parliament,
as a first resolution, decided to be hands-off,
which is fantastic. We don't want over-regulation. But we do want the regulation on the financial part because to use this technology,
you need the token. Although it is not
a cryptocurrency per se, it has that financial aspect. Therefore, we would like to see more clarity in
the regulation there, and that is a global issue. In the energy sector, we want more regulatory
sandboxes so that we can pilot
the solutions to work on them. There are governments like
the UK government and Ofgem that have done this
already a year and a half ago. Others are lagging behind. We'd like for these more
progressive regulators to take the lead and influence positive competition
among regulators. But we have to talk
to them for sure. So part of our time
is to do that. Then there is this very
interesting aspect of governance because in essence, what we're doing
is replicating to market with this new technology. Then market rules,
you have to make sure that you're compliant with
different market rules. I'm not only talking about
data privacy and security. It's also just general
competition rules. So I think that's coming next, and we will need to work with regulators to make sure that the market rules are replicating what is happening
in the real physical world.
