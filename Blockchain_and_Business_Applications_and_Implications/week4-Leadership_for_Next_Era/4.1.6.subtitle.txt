What's the reaction, Ben, of regulators to your work on structured financial products? So when we approached the UK's Financial
Conduct Authority, we presented our case,
our business, what we wanted to create, to use blockchain technology to broaden access to
structured products, and their response was positive. Because what we tested
with the regulator was to demonstrate whether a blockchain technology can
make this products cheaper, faster to exchange,
they ask to the money, and also make them
more transparent. So the UK's regulator
has a sandbox. So they're one of the most forward-looking
regulators globally. So when we entered, we were successful to be accepted in the FCA
regulatory sandbox, and we tested within
their control environment, blockchain technology by using the world's first
structure product on a blockchain to be cleared
settled in custody. At the same time, we issued a second structure product of the same economics but using the traditional
financial system. The outcome of
this experiment was that the extraction product
issued using blockchain technology
was cheaper, was faster, and the regulator, and the issuer, and the investor had better visibility
on their product. From the regulator's perspective and from the financial
service perspective, it also enhances compliance. Because when you have
a security which is tokenized, you can have
visibility real-time. So the regulator has
better visibility, the issuer has better visibility, and all the right counter
parties on the chain of events. So the approach from
the regulator was positive. We did this test in the
beginning of last year of 2018, which gave us
very good visibility. This also helped us, as follow-up, be accepted in two of the world's best
FinTech accelerators. We are also currently in the UK Investment Management
Association accelerator, which is the UK industry body for asset management's
first accelerator. Essentially, this gave us a very good boost in
a very young startup.
