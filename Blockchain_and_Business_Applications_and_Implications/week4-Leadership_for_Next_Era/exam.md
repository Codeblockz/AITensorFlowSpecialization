Question 1
What can we learn about blockchain regulation from attempts to regulate the Internet?




Like early Internet developers, those working in the blockchain industry have more expertise than most regulators do 


The “hands-off” approach to regulation used for the Internet won’t necessarily work for blockchain, because when it comes to assets, people expect their interests to be protected


Self-regulation should be favored over state-based regulation


x All of the above




2.
Question 2
Why is it difficult to establish regulations for cryptocurrencies?




Cryptocurrencies can act like a currency, a commodity, a security, or some combination of all three, depending on their characteristics, how they’re being used, and who’s using them.


Regulators can’t predict what will happen if they apply existing regimes to new paradigms; just because policymakers can make existing laws work for cryptocurrencies, doesn’t mean that they should.


Premature rulemaking can create confusion for emerging industries, particularly when poorly thought-out rules result in multiple judicial challenges.


x All of the above
