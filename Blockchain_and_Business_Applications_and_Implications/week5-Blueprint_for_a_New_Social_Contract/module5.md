# Module 5 Blueprint for a New Social Contract

As the digital revolution unfolds, it is driving profound changes in the global economy, labor markets, old institutions, and society as a whole. To realize the potential of the blockchain revolution, we need business leaders to come to the table as responsible and active participants in a new social contract for both their own long-term interests as well as in the interest of a healthy society and economy. In this module, you will explore possible directions for a new social contract—i.e. the agreements, laws, and behaviors that people, companies, civil society, and their governments adhere to. The aim of this module is not to provide a definitive strategy for instituting and enforcing a new social contract, but rather to catalyze investigation, debate, and action.

# Learning Objectives
- Explain what a “social contract” is
- Identify problems with the current social contract (e.g. structural unemployment, growing inequality, asymmetrical power)
- Describe the promise and possibilities of blockchain technology to support the creation of a new social contract
