The digital revolution
is unfolding and it's driving profound changes
in the global economy. It's changing our labour markets, social institutions, and
the health of our biosphere. But the gap between haves
and have-nots is widening. There are problems. Growing inequality, economic inequality only
worsens these problems. We have extreme weather, climate change beginning to
displace whole populations. Now we need to refocus
creating value for all stakeholders and not just
now but in the long-term. Business can lead this effort by rethinking the firm
and rethinking work. We can help distribute power more fairly among stakeholders
not just shareholders. We need business
leaders to come to the table and to realize
the potential of blockchain. We need them to take
part in writing and upholding nothing less than
a new social contract. It's not just for
their own long-term interest, it's in the interest
of all stakeholders, their workers, their customers, and suppliers, and
the communities within which they operate. It's not just for
their shareholders and their top executives. So in this module, we'll look at
possible directions for a new social contract. Social contract refers
to the agreements, the laws and the behaviors that people adhere to in
their companies, their social circles,
and their governments. Our goal is not to map out the be-all and end-all strategy for creating and rolling out a new social contract with blockchain technology
as a platform. Instead, we want to
create a conversation. We'd like you to think
about the challenges, contribute your ideas to the discussion forum
and debate the issues. What actions can you take
to get the ball rolling?
