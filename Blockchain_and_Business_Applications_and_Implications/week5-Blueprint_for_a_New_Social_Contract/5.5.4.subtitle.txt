After the beta which was
again like a desktop app, we focused our attention
on also releasing a web app simply because
of the adoption, let's say, many
people use a browser. It was quite an interesting
journey because we've rewritten the IPFS part which stands for
the Inter-Planetary File System. So what we did there is like, even if it looks like
a normal website that you visit, in the background when
you're reading an article, your browser connects
peer-to-peer with the browser of another person
that published the article. So again, like at every step
we are trying to remove ourselves from the middle of
this flow of communication, and create a framework enabling people to communicate
peer-to-peer.
