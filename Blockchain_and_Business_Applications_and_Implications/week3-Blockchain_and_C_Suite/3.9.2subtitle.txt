[MUSIC] I think large enterprises sometimes
become their own captives. It's so important for leadership at large
organizations, everyone in the c-suite has to participate in not just
the operational excellence that represents a company like ours but
in the what's next conversation. I call it, up and out. So it's really important here at our
company that we spend some time up and out thinking about what's next. Thinking about innovations that
are changing the world around us. Thinking about disruption that have the
potential to change our business model. And so with something like blockchain,
it was a pretty natural investment for us to make to say, mm-hm,
this seems interesting. This seems like a really
important evolution if not complete revolution in
the way custody works. And so when your business
that's all about custody, it wasn't a huge leap for
us to make some investments. But at the same time,
we had to unencumber those teams. We couldn't put them in a little box and
say, here is how far you go. We had to let them explore the world
of blockchain as it was emerging. They had to get engaged in the forums and
communities and the tweet deck and
everything going on out there to understand how relevant
this would be for us. It's in our DNA to embrace
that kind of change, but I encourage all companies out there to
stretch their own comfort zones and be willing to make some investments in things
that may or may not come to fruition. So we don't know what will happen
with blockchain ultimately, but it was definitely something that we
didn't want to be on the sidelines for. So getting in the game is the number
one piece of advice that I would give any company or team out there.
