Congratulations on completing
this module on the C-Suite. You're one step closer
to understanding the impact of blockchain
on the enterprise. Let's review. You've learned CEOs set the tone at the top. They need to embrace
blockchain by focusing on market readiness, effective marketing strategies, and avoiding unrealistic
expectations. If they got onboard, employees and customers
will also get on board. You've learned that COOs oversee the movement of assets
through global supply chains. They can use blockchain
and procurement, manufacturing and retail to adapt and respond to
demands and crises. You've learned how
corporate council need staff who can code, or audit smart contracts. They also need to stay
on top of lawsuits and regulatory actions involving
blockchain technology, crypto assets and patents. You've learned how CFOs have
more tools for managing their short-term capital,
and long-term investments. They can tokenize
the company's physical assets, and maybe even create
all new types of crypto assets. They can also apply
triple entry accounting and issue financial statements
with the press of a button. You've learned how CMOs will be shifting their companies toward a pay for attention model. They'll be able to
show clear return on marketing investment with greater confidence
in the integrity and accuracy of consumer data. You've learned that
CIOs and CTOs, need to be communicating
their bold visions, coordinating innovation
across the enterprise, and cultivating
blockchain talent. They also need to keep an eye on threats like quantum computing, and you've learned
how CHROs can pioneer blockchain HR applications
by promoting diverse views, and re-imagining
their own job functions. For more on these topics, see the new preface to the paperback edition of
Blockchain Revolution. If you have any questions, please check out

collaborator Don Tapscott, and our academic
partner in INSEAD, thank you for joining us.
