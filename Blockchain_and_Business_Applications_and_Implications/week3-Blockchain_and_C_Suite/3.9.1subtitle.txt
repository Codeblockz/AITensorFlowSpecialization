When it comes to the traditionally
organized companies, I think it's useful just as
we took a couple of steps back and look at
our societal way of organizing, to look also at the way companies as organizations are organized. If you think about it, even the naming has
a hangover from the army. So you have the Chief
Executive Officer, the keyword here, and then
you have the Chief x Officer. So the officer, why an officer? Makes you wonder. So
I think the way in which the entrepreneurs
and the [inaudible] which currently the organization
is counting on to have this broader view
and to understand where to steer
the organization and so on, should embrace also this idea
that organizations as the fundamental structure on
top of which they are built, might be subject to
change and might be benefiting from some
of these improvements. It doesn't have to be
an overall make over, it can go in steps, one at a time, but just starting to think along these lines and to explore how the business can
integrate some of these things to
increase efficiency, to increase transparency, to have all these
things in place, also to be open to
lateral growth is key. The companies that will be
able to make this step and the leaders that we'll be able to identify these opportunities, will be the ones that will
be the most successful.
