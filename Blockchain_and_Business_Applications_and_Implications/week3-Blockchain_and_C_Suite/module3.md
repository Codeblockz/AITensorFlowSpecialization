## 3.1.1 Module 3 Overview: Intro to the C-Suite

changes to executive functions. Starting with the top
- Navigating the balance between the hype and the promise of Blockchain is a key responsibility of a company's senior management team
  - Executives must decide whether they're companies should adopt blockchain early and start experimenting now, or wait until the technology matures and risk lagging behind more aggressive competitors
- how senior management can balance the hype and the hope and make key decisions about Blockchain for their enterprise. 
  - operations, legal, finance and accounting, sales and marketing, IT, and human resources.

# 3.2 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

## 3.2.1 The CEO

- Here's a pro tip: The tone starts at the top
  - Business strategy isn't just about proving your company gets the blockchain, it's about associating your brand with the future
    - This means tallying and retallying your blockchain storage across a variety of communication channels, 
      - not just staff meetings, 
      - but press interviews, industry conferences, analysts calls, corporate blogs, and lots of client engagements, maybe write a position paper on it. 
      - For ideas, take a look at Scott Nelson's white papers. He's the CEO and Founder of Sweetbridge. [see pdf](3.2.1Scott_Nelson_white_papers-Sweetbridge-Whitepaper-20180529.pdf)

- three ways that a CEO can lead team and set the proper tone.
  - acknowledging market readiness and good financial results.
    - your company needs to get on the learning curve. That means watching blockchain pilots closely, taking part in **proof-of-concepts**, designing your own.
  - effective marketing and communications
    - employees are entering unknown territory. They don't understand new initiatives, and they may struggle to support them. So managers need to pay great attention to internal messages, **training**, and also to incentives
  - avoid setting unrealistic expectations

# 3.3 The Chief Operating Officer (COO)

## 3.3.1 COO

- how COOs will oversee the supply chain revolution
  - Global supply chains manage most of our global trade. There's an estimated value of $50 trillion that goes through them. 
  - Blockchain offers us a record volume of data that could help us study large-scale economic systems like never before. 
    - Why? 
      - Because every asset has a supply chain. 
  - Global supply chains are ripe for disruptions at every level, and in every role. 
  - COOs get perhaps the best glimpse of this transformation. They oversee the movement of all these assets that go through their company. They could help reinvent global commerce as we know it.

- how are organizations, big and small, applying blockchain?
  - 6 industries and their approaches. Industry Applications of Blockchain
    - 1. manufacturing
      - Foxconn
        - Foxconn Technology Group is one of the largest technology manufacturers in the world, and is part of one of the biggest and most complicated supply chains. It's testing advanced cryptographic techniques, and decentralized networks. Foxconn's goal is to solve its integration problems, and transform its operations. It's using blockchain as a trustable platform, for building relationships among partners, suppliers, and customers, who may not otherwise trust each other.
    - 2. mining
      - diamonds
        - Diamonds may be created under pressure, but for industry leaders and consumers, the less stress, the better. The blockchain startup, Everledger, is taking on supply chain problems like fraud, and property rights, and provenance in the diamond industry.
        - Buyers will be confident, that the stones they purchased are legitimate. Stolen diamonds can be traced back to the rightful owners.
    - 3. agriculture
      - Blockchain can reduce health hazards, and screen out bad actors in the global food chain. It helps track the quality of crops and soil, and it also helps reduce waste and increase local yields. It can even match excess yields with those in need of food.
    - 4. retail
      - Walmart
        - Walmart, is one of the largest companies in the United States, and the largest grocer in North America. It worked with IBM to pilot a blockchain solution for food safety. The results were positive. It increased efficiency, it reduced impact on cargo, and checked the conditions of transport and storage of foodstuffs. 
    - 5.  border control and customs
      - COOs face issues like lengthy delays at ports and border crossings, delays due to, piles of paperwork and changing rules and regulations. Blockchain technology can help track money, goods, and people as they pass through customs, verify their identity, and automate paperwork. Imagine the cost, and time savings. 
    - 6. aerospace
      - Moog
        - Moog, is a global designer, manufacturer, and integrator of motion control systems. It's clients could face catastrophe if its supply chain falls apart. Moog deployed blockchain to secure the transfer and use of 3D printing design files, so they couldn't be tampered with and would print exactly the number of parts paid for in remote locations.

-  The global supply chain, will be more adaptable and responsive to demand, and crisis if it runs on the blockchain. 
   -  COOs are grappling with a number of emerging technologies, not just blockchain and distributed ledgers, but artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Combined, these may automate more of operations, procurement and purchasing, transportation and logistics as well as trade, finance, and even insurance.

# 3.4 The Chief Legal Officer (CLO)

## 3.4.1 Video The CLO

- Blockchain aids the contracting process whether short or long term. - Smart contracts can automate terms. 
  - They can refer to data fields elsewhere online, known as Oracles, such as a party's account balance or a change in a commodity price. 
  - They can trigger alerts and automate payments. 
  - Smart contracts are self-enforcing and so corporations will not want to enter them lightly. 
   
- Chief Counsel and corporate lawyers will need to learn how to audit legal templates and make sure the contract software supports what it's parties intended it to do.


- Lesson Learned
  - One, stick with well-tested methods for creating and running Smart contracts, keep it simple. And 
  - two, make sure you have someone on staff who can audit the code of a smart contract template or the code of a distributed app behind an ICO or other crypto asset



- Lawyers 
  - also need to stay on top of cases involving block chain. 
  - Those include 
    - smart contracts, 
    - initial coin offerings, and 
    - patent filings and 
    - across jurisdictions.


- Rationale 理论基础 for Blockchain patent application 
  - to profit from their invention
  - to prevent others from using their invention
  - to make an invention available to collaborators

- Blockchain patent application criteria
  - it must be eligible
  - it must be truly novel
  - the design must be non-obvious

# 3.5 The Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

## 3.5.1 Video The CFO

- CFOs balance the internal markets of corporations with the external markets of finance. They must understand the profound changes in store.
- basic 8 functions the industry provides, in no particular order. 
  - The industry forces anti money laundering and know-your-customer regulations. 
  - It verifies identity and account balances, 
  - it facilitates payments, savings, loans, asset exchanges, investment, insurance, risk management, and accounting. 
- Blockchain, it turns out, is transforming all of these.
- double book keeping
  - we used for centuries
  - every transaction you record a debit and a credit, and 
  - in the end, the books must balance, which is why we call it a balance sheet.
- triple-entry book keeping
  - Blockchain is now giving rise to an alternative
  - The idea was circulated first by cryptographer, Ian Grigg, before the release of the Bitcoin blockchain.
    -  a cryptographically sealed record of transactions was the same as a third-entry extending double-entry systems. 
    -  The idea translated into a shared receipt on the blockchain.

  - It underscores our ability to write transactions to a blockchain in real time and between multiple parties. 
  - It results in a ledger showing the whole history of assets and the relationship among transactions. 
  - That's more than a credible audit trail. 
- The CFO is one of the main leaders inside the enterprise, and the finance role involves everything from cash flow and risk management to capital investing, corporate recruiting, and strategy.

- Abstract:
  - Within each industry, distributed ledger technology is influencing the value chain and the role of a CFO. This project outlines why the CFO, as the CEO’s business partner, should understand blockchain’s impact on enterprise strategy, not just on corporate finance, capital investment, and operations. It shows how blockchain could catalyze change in the near term, with finance use cases in taxation, accounting and audit processes and in digital asset payments for consumer goods, employee payroll, and cross-border transactions. In the longer term, CFOs will help make the business case for blockchain applications in trade finance, supply chain financing, and insurance. To prepare for that future, CFOs must understand token economics, initial coin offerings, and blockchain-based analytics.

# 3.6 The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

## 3.6.1 Video: The CMO

- 4 Ps in marketing
  - Product
  - Placement
  - Price
  - Promotion

- The 4 P's were useful tools when producers could push their messages through the broadcast model of media, 
- **but that paradigm has now shifted**
- reviews
  - Consumers can share their views with each other through blogs, social media, and consumer reviews
    - Marketers can engage customers in all aspects of marketing and branding, from design and packaging to advertising sales and delivery. 
- Blockchain's biggest opportunities require a shift in **marketing strategy**. 
- changes because of blockchain
  - customer own their own data
    - Past and now:
      - Profiling customers online by tracking their behavior, capturing all their data might soon be a thing of the past. 
    - Future
      - Consumers in the future will own and control their own data through virtual black boxes set up on blockchains. 
      - Marketing and sales staff, will need to learn how to query these black boxes. 
        - Some consumers may allow access to their data in exchange for freebies or some other goodies. 
        - Others may charge companies a fee to license their data. 
  - better search precision
    - The quality of results should increase whatever the incentive.
    - Companies will find their target audiences with greater precision.
    - Smart contracts can improve the performance of search engine optimization and price negotiation. 
    - Advertisers will know exactly which elements of their ad budgets delivered results, and when it comes to get customers attention. 
    - We're headed towards a pay-for-attention model with blockchain based identity systems. 
  - blockchain advertising
    -  let's advertisers pay end users directly for their attention to ads. 
    -  now
       -  73 percent of all your ad dollars go to Facebook and Google. 
    -  blockchain advertising
       -  Retailers and manufacturers could also cut the cost of collecting and protecting consumer data
 -  How do blockchain technologies shape the CMO's of the future? Jeremy Epstein pointed out six possibilities
    -  1. a CMO will be asked to demonstrate return on marketing investment
    -  2. disrupting advertising will yield new insights and challenges
    -  3. smart contracts will clearly show what CMO's are doing to up the return on every marketing dollar
    -  4. more innovative and easier-to-understand loyalty programs will emerge
    -  5. the marketing organization will flatten from a hierarchy to a network
    -  6. brands will no longer make claims, at least not claims they can't support. They'll be able to provide proofs. 
    -  Overall, blockchain enables companies to cut intermediary fees and institutional bias. CMO's can finally go straight to the customer and gain actionable insights at scale

# 3.7 The Chief Information Officer and Chief Technology Officer (CIO & CTO)

## 3.7.1 Video CIO CTO

- CIO CTO job
  - The job is a tough one. It involves securing the enterprise against cyberattacks and systems failure, while transforming IT architecture for the Fourth Industrial Revolution
- 4th industrial revolution
  - It involves 
    - artificial intelligence, machine learning, 
    - advanced robotics, 
    - smart buildings, 
    - autonomous fleets, 
    - the Internet of things, 
    - additive manufacturing, 
    - energy microgrids, and even 
    - biotechnology. 
  - blockchain  
    - We see blockchain as a **coordinating mechanism** for all of these emerging technologies. 
    - It will support 
      - reliable search, 
      - verification of device IDs and accounts, 
      - execution of distributed apps and smart contracts, 
      - micropayment systems, and 
      - exchanges of tokenized assets
- CIOs and CTOs will have to go beyond implementing enterprise business strategy
  - using or recommending a range of technologies
  - 4 key ways to do this
    - 1. CIOs and CTOs must effectively communicate their bold visions of the future 大胆的愿景
      - Their peers in the C-suite will need help understanding these evolving technologies, and their impact on enterprise strategy.
    - 2. need to orchestrate innovation across the enterprise
      - Blockchain technology will affect external processes and enterprise architecture. 
      - Moving business logic and business processes out of enterprise silos and on to shared blockchains will help to coordinate internal initiatives with industry efforts, such as the Hyperledger project, or the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.
    - 3. cultivate the necessary skills, talent, and relationships in house or in the network. 
      - There's already a shortage of accomplished blockchain developers who understand smart contracts in blockchain integration. 
      - Attending blockchain meetups and participating in consortia can help to build these key connections.
    - 4. CIOs and CTOs should keep an eye on quantum computing.
      - Google has already built a 72-qubit processor. Qubits are quantum bits, rather than conventional ones. 
      - Quantum processors can solve extremely difficult math problems really fast, and this can potentially shatter public-key cryptography and weekend symmetric key cryptography. 
        - It can undermine the cyber security now protecting your enterprise infrastructure and systems. 
      - Some block chains are technically quantum resistant, 
        - but it would be foolish to assume that any system is completely unhackable. 
      - Users don't always protect their private keys. 
      - Developers make trade-offs between security and scalability at the implementation layer. 
      - CIOs and CTOs should audit their systems. 
        - Which data are vulnerable because of encryption? 
        - What is the threat level and the timing? 
        - It makes no sense to deploy a blockchain that's not quantum resistant, if not quantum proof, for managing your most valuable assets. 
      - when quantem computing 
        - Now, experts say there's a one in seven 1/7 chance a quantum computer will be commercially available by 2026, and that's less than a decade away. 
        - By 2031, the odds become one in two 1/2. 
    - CIOs and CTOs who take these actions will be preparing their enterprise architecture for the fourth industrial age.

# 3.8 The Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)

## 3.8.1 Video CHRO

- HR
  - Human resources or HR, is a strategic asset rather than a cost center when treated properly. 
  - It's leaders must be open to and willing to experiment with new technologies such as Blockchain for managing talent. Signing up experts in this field is a valuable long-term investment. 
  - The growing challenge lies in working outside of traditional organizational boundaries. 
- Organizations, especially the HR professionals in them, must think more in terms of tasks needing to be done rather than positions that needed to be filled.
- Among HR's most immediate concerns is diversity.
  - men/women
    - Like many technology-driven businesses, the Blockchain revolution is overpopulated with men. The lots of the best tactical minds in the industry are in fact women. 
    - Women hold only 25 percent of all computing jobs more generally.
  - color
    - People of color are also unrepresented by 16 to 18 percent based on estimates.
    - This is an unhealthy disparity that CHROs have the power to remedy.
  - need diversity
    - we need a variety of viewpoints, be they male, female, gay, straight, old, young, whatever. 
    - Not enough diversity can lead to problem-solving deadlock. An innovation relies on a wide variety of views to conceive of every possible error to test it and to solve it
    - Assembling and dispersing a diversity of talent can be far more effective and profitable than the traditional hiring and retaining model.
- in 4 ways HR professionals can learn how to leverage Blockchain 
  - finding the right people, 
  - negotiating their contracts, 
  - implementing the terms, and 
  - coordinating their contributions. 
- The Blockchain transformation of the HR function is expected to occur in three waves. 
  - The first wave, will resolve fundamental issues with recruitment. 
    - HR professionals will use Blockchain to query candidate's black boxes of data, confirm their identity, and verify their credentials. HR will no longer have to worry about puffed up distorted or inaccurate resumes. Candidates will be held accountable for their experience and skills. Payment can also occur at nearly real-time for output or time worked for staff or for contract workers. 
  - The second wave will provide benefits in the broader talent ecosystem
    - It will also reduce the number of full-time employment contracts. Smart contracts will be key here in measuring the strategic importance of tasks, and deciding whether they can be outsource.
  - third wave. The technology allows for the sourcing and execution of work projects
    - CHROs will restructure contractual relationships. They'll bring in workers and services separately as needed.
- HR professionals will need to reimagine their function and transform with the technology. 
  - Some jobs maybe eliminated. Some HR processes may be automated, and others will be managed by algorithms
    - New jobs though will also be created, and these will require innovation to fill. CHROs should focus on finding platforms for self-organizing teams. These would need to quantify and predict team performance. CHROs also need to safeguard talents systems so they remain effective, fair, and inclusive.
