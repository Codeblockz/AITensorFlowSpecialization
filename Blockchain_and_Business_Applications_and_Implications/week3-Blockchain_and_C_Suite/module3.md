# Module 3 Blockchain and C-Suite

Because blockchain changes the deep structures and architecture of the firm, it will consequently transform our models of management and the roles of the C-Suite. Navigating the balance between blockchain’s hype and its true potential is a key responsibility of an organization’s management team. In this module, you will learn about some of the decisions and changes that business leaders can anticipate when considering how the future of blockchain will unfold within their business.

## Learning Objectives
Explain how blockchain will transform the roles and functions of the C-Suite (e.g. CEO, CFO, CMO, CIO, CHRO, COO, CLO)

changes to executive functions. Starting with the top
- Navigating the balance between the hype and the promise of Blockchain is a key responsibility of a company's senior management team
  - Executives must decide whether they're companies should adopt blockchain early and start experimenting now, or wait until the technology matures and risk lagging behind more aggressive competitors
- how senior management can balance the hype and the hope and make key decisions about Blockchain for their enterprise. 
  - operations, legal, finance and accounting, sales and marketing, IT, and human resources.

# 3.2 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

## 3.2.1 The CEO

- Here's a pro tip: The tone starts at the top
  - Business strategy isn't just about proving your company gets the blockchain, it's about associating your brand with the future
    - This means tallying and retallying your blockchain storage across a variety of communication channels, 
      - not just staff meetings, 
      - but press interviews, industry conferences, analysts calls, corporate blogs, and lots of client engagements, maybe write a position paper on it. 
      - For ideas, take a look at Scott Nelson's white papers. He's the CEO and Founder of Sweetbridge. [see pdf](3.2.1Scott_Nelson_white_papers-Sweetbridge-Whitepaper-20180529.pdf)

- three ways that a CEO can lead team and set the proper tone.
  - acknowledging market readiness and good financial results.
    - your company needs to get on the learning curve. That means watching blockchain pilots closely, taking part in **proof-of-concepts**, designing your own.
  - effective marketing and communications
    - employees are entering unknown territory. They don't understand new initiatives, and they may struggle to support them. So managers need to pay great attention to internal messages, **training**, and also to incentives
  - avoid setting unrealistic expectations

# 3.3 The Chief Operating Officer (COO)

## 3.3.1 COO

- how COOs will oversee the supply chain revolution
  - Global supply chains manage most of our global trade. There's an estimated value of $50 trillion that goes through them. 
  - Blockchain offers us a record volume of data that could help us study large-scale economic systems like never before. 
    - Why? 
      - Because every asset has a supply chain. 
  - Global supply chains are ripe for disruptions at every level, and in every role. 
  - COOs get perhaps the best glimpse of this transformation. They oversee the movement of all these assets that go through their company. They could help reinvent global commerce as we know it.

- how are organizations, big and small, applying blockchain?
  - 6 industries and their approaches. Industry Applications of Blockchain
    - 1. manufacturing
      - Foxconn
        - Foxconn Technology Group is one of the largest technology manufacturers in the world, and is part of one of the biggest and most complicated supply chains. It's testing advanced cryptographic techniques, and decentralized networks. Foxconn's goal is to solve its integration problems, and transform its operations. It's using blockchain as a trustable platform, for building relationships among partners, suppliers, and customers, who may not otherwise trust each other.
    - 2. mining
      - diamonds
        - Diamonds may be created under pressure, but for industry leaders and consumers, the less stress, the better. The blockchain startup, Everledger, is taking on supply chain problems like fraud, and property rights, and provenance in the diamond industry.
        - Buyers will be confident, that the stones they purchased are legitimate. Stolen diamonds can be traced back to the rightful owners.
    - 3. agriculture
      - Blockchain can reduce health hazards, and screen out bad actors in the global food chain. It helps track the quality of crops and soil, and it also helps reduce waste and increase local yields. It can even match excess yields with those in need of food.
    - 4. retail
      - Walmart
        - Walmart, is one of the largest companies in the United States, and the largest grocer in North America. It worked with IBM to pilot a blockchain solution for food safety. The results were positive. It increased efficiency, it reduced impact on cargo, and checked the conditions of transport and storage of foodstuffs. 
    - 5.  border control and customs
      - COOs face issues like lengthy delays at ports and border crossings, delays due to, piles of paperwork and changing rules and regulations. Blockchain technology can help track money, goods, and people as they pass through customs, verify their identity, and automate paperwork. Imagine the cost, and time savings. 
    - 6. aerospace
      - Moog
        - Moog, is a global designer, manufacturer, and integrator of motion control systems. It's clients could face catastrophe if its supply chain falls apart. Moog deployed blockchain to secure the transfer and use of 3D printing design files, so they couldn't be tampered with and would print exactly the number of parts paid for in remote locations.

-  The global supply chain, will be more adaptable and responsive to demand, and crisis if it runs on the blockchain. 
   -  COOs are grappling with a number of emerging technologies, not just blockchain and distributed ledgers, but artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Combined, these may automate more of operations, procurement and purchasing, transportation and logistics as well as trade, finance, and even insurance.
