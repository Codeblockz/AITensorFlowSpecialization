Question 7
Why would using “bAirbnb” (a blockchain-based version of Airbnb) be advantageous compared to its non-blockchain counterpart?
1 / 1 point


Owners and renters could transact directly, saving on fees that would otherwise be collected by a third-party service provider.


It would mitigate concerns over privacy breaches or identity theft, since there would be no central database to hack and transactions would be conducted pseudonymously.


Smart contracts would make payments and access to the property more efficient (e.g. via smart lock technology).


!All of the above


Correct
All of the above are reasons why using a blockchain-based version of Airbnb would be advantageous compared to its non-blockchain counterpart.

Question 9
In what way(s) does blockchain technology support artists and other creators of value?

!All of the above


Correct
All of the above represent ways that blockchain technology can support artists and other creators of value.
