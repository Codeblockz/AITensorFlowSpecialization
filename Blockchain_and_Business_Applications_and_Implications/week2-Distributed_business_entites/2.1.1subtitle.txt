Thank you for joining us. In this module, we explore how blockchain technology can affect current business models. Imagine what we can do
with smart contracts, peer to peer payments systems, and digital platforms
with built-in trust. By the end of this week, you will be able to
define terms like the distributed application
also known as a DAP. You will know
the differences between an autonomous agent and open networked enterprise and a distributed
autonomous enterprise. They all sound like
a mouthful but they won't at the end of this, and look at the cautionary
tale of the DAO. This was an investment
fund that did some extraordinary things
but ultimately failed. It's an example of
what can go wrong with the Smart Contract
and the importance of effective
blockchain governance. You will be able to describe
seven business models for open networked enterprises and how blockchain technology could improve each of these models. You will be able to
identify some approaches to managing intellectual property
using blockchain. We'll see how blockchain
based platforms can help distribute
ownership of wealth. They can encourage
innovation and provide new sources of
capital for creators. Now if you have questions or comments please go to
the discussion forum, and for a preview of
these business bottles checkout Chapter 5 of
blockchain revolution. On behalf of my co-author, Alex Tapscott and
our academic partner [inaudible] thank
you for joining us.
