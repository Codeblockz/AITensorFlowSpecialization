Some of you guys may be
graduating from the college. Some of you are thinking
about your future career. Some of you think about
changing your career. So there are enough IT
professions available out there. We've got Business Analytics, we've got
programming, we've got systems analysis, but now we're introducing
something new to you, which is Information Systems Auditing. So now you might ask yourself. Compare to those other IT technologies,
other IT professions, how about IS audit? Compare IS audit with other technologies. Would it be a profession that you all
think about to go for your future? So for that question,
I would like to ask of, course, practitioner, the partner
of a big four company. Having lot of experience and
recruiting yourself. So what kind of advice that you
would like to give to them? >> I think, for those other IT field,
we're not talking about the IS audit. I think many of the students
could be familiar with that. >> That's true, that's true, that's true. >> Some of them may think about being
a programmer, business analyst, etc. >> Or systems analysis, right,
developing new systems, yeah, yeah. I think for that part, I believe
many of the students may know that- >> Will have an idea. >> Yeah, but then for IS audit, we usually
kick start as an entry level IS auditor, and they will have the chances to
learn a lot of basic control concept, what are the risk concept
especially on the IT areas. So that they can know what are the risk
that the clients' system may have. What sort of controls they have
to put in place to mitigate that. >> So the true keywords are Risk and
Control. >> Yes, yeah, that's right. >> Okay. >> And also at the same times,
as an entry level IS auditor, as I mentioned previously, they need to
know other than IS knowledge, they would also need to like enhance their knowledge
from the business perspective. >> Yes. >> Because when they go into an audit engagement-
>> That's right. >> Or they face the auditee, they would
have to know what are the process- >> The business process, how they do the business. They not only we can give them some IT
advice, but how they can streamline. So understanding the business
process is also very important. >> Yeah, I guess they have to know how the
IT system is actually helping the business process-
>> To get the leverage. >> Right.
>> Okay. >> So that when they provide
the recommendation to the clients or to the auditee, they will know, the recommendation would be really
putting from a perspective that can fit into the business operation
itself rather than just like purely giving a very technical advice to them-
>> And sometime management may not understand
those technical jargons as well, right? >> Right.
>> To a certain extent. >> Yeah.
>> And depending on the exposure, yes. >> Yeah, so that's why for
an entry level IS auditor, they have to know this kind of knowledge
so that they can go into the clients and work well with the auditee and
provide the recommendation. And then for the career path, that the IS
auditors will usually face is that from the entry level, then they
will proceeded to the senior level. >> Yup.
>> And then to manager level. >> Okay. >> To senior manager or
associate director, and then to director, then to partner in a big four. But of course, for some of them, they may
work in in-house, may not be in a firm. Then similar path, they may like at very
senior level, they would be like, for example head of IT audit, or
head of audit or even a chief auditor. So this is the career path that usually
the IS auditor may face, if the student is really interested in that, they can
anticipate the career path. >> Yes, I've been knowing Gloria for
a long time, and if you look at her background,
she of course graduated to here in HKUST, Hong Kong University and
technology but not in IT. But she graduated in accounting and
then she learn and then your company trained you and now you have been here and
you're enjoying what you're doing for so many years and you climb up the ladder,
you become senior partner. So it's the training that give and
then you are a very good example being in the company for so
long, enjoying what you're doing, right? So it is something, satisfaction that you
have it as a practitioner of information systems auditing. >> Exactly because there are a lot
of exposure in different companies because you can imagine even
as an entry level auditors, you can face different
companies as your auditee. You can really get a lot of ideas
in terms of different industry, what are the difficulties that they face
and what are the challenges they have. And you can see the latest
trend of the technology and could actually really help them
by providing your advice to them. >> Yes, so you could see the takeaway for
you all is this. You don't have to have a technical
background to get into IS audit field. So Gloria is one of a very
good example for that, because she started with
the accounting degree and then she get into the IT auditing field, and
she's been very successful in her area. So that's the takeaway for you all. Thank you, Gloria. >> Thank you.
