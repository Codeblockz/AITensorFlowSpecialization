1. Question 1
What is risk?



The happening of an event is uncertain


refers to natural disasters, while human impact is not part of the risk


The happening of an event must lead to the loss of money


x The happening of an event is uncertain, with possibility to bring positive and/or negative impacts



2. Question 2
In the lecture video 1.2, Prof. Dias mentioned that internal man-made threat is more serious than an external man-made threat. 

Why is it so?



External man-made threat can be eliminated by having right security architecture


Internal man-made threat cannot be detected


x Internal man-made threat is relatively more difficult to be prevented as if a staff is intended to steal the digital assets which he / she is being granted with corresponding access rights to such digital assets according to his/her roles


External man-made threat is less vulnerable to an organization’s secret information since hackers do not normally possess good understanding on an organization’s technology architecture



3. Question 3
When determine the risk level of an event, which two elements of such event should be assessed?



“Impact” and “Source of impact (i.e. internal or external)”


“Management’s appetite” and “Resource availability”


x “Impact” and “Probability”


“Timing” and “Duration”



4. Question 4
When making decisions to mitigate a risk, which of the following statement is NOT correct?



None of them is correct


The more controls you put in, the higher the cost of controls


x Risk can ultimately be eliminated by putting in the maximum level of controls


The more controls you put in, the more risk can be mitigated



5. Question 5
After the remaining risk is being transferred to third party after the completion of risk mitigation exercise, which of the following statement is correct?



Risk level is lowered since the probability of having the relevant event to happen is reduced


Risk is eliminated


x The same risk level remains, however the impact posses by the relevant event will be compensated by the third party


Risk level is lowered since the impact posses by the relevant event is reduced



6. Question 6
When is the best time to conduct risk re-evaluation against an activity?



Engaging new technology to conduct such activity


Changing of relevant regulatory requirements


According to the periodic risk re-evaluation requirements as per internal control policy (e.g. every 12 months)


x When any of these conditions happen, risk re-evaluation should be conducted



7. Question 7
Which of the following is a detective control to address unauthorized network access?



x Reviewing of system access log regularly


Enforcing strong password policy


Granting network access to the system from designated MAC and IP address of a network device


Using username and password to authenticate legitimate users to access a system



8. Question 8
Preventive controls could prevent a risk being realized. Should we only implement preventive controls?



x No – none of the preventive, detective and corrective controls could solely help to mitigate risk effectively, and not everything risk can be prevented or detected so implementing a combination of these types of controls would provide the best protection to the organisation
 


Yes – preventive controls and the other types of controls are mutually exclusive, we only need to implement the best type


Yes – cost of implementing preventive controls is lower than the other types of controls


No – cost of implementing preventive controls is higher than the other types of controls



9. Question 9
What is the control category of “data backup and restoration”?



Preventive control


Corrective control


x Both preventive and corrective


Detective control



10. Question 10
Your company is looking into the feasibility of building the data center near the coast and your supervisor would like you to conduct a risk assessment exercise. How would you get started?



Avoid the risk by not setting up any data centers


x Use the risk matrix to calculate the impact and probability of the risk


Buy an insurance policy to eliminate all the risk straightaway


List all the ways possible to mitigate the risk and apply them into the company immediately
