  - In normal situation, usually if compliance testing pass, we don't have to do substantive testing,
  - We do substantive testing in two different situations. 
    - One is employees, organizations do not follow policies and procedures or regulations. 
    - Second thing is this, we don't have enough controls. That means controls are weak or we don't have controls at all.
