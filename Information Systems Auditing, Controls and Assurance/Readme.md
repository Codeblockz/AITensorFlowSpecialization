## Introduction

Information systems (IS) are important assets to business organizations and are ubiquitous in our daily lives. 

With the latest IS technologies emerging, such as Big Data, FinTech, Virtual Banks, there are more concerns from the public on how organizations maintain systems’ integrity, such as data privacy, information security, the compliance to the government regulations. Management in organizations also need to be assured that systems work the way they expected. IS auditors play a crucial role in handling these issues.

In the course “Information Systems Auditing, Controls and Assurance”, you will explore risks of information systems, and how to mitigate the risks by proper IS Controls. You will also get familiar with the IS Audit procedures and how they are applied during the IS development throughout the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

Finally, you will get to observe how we can make the system changes more manageable using formal IS Management practices, such as Change Management Controls and Emergency Changes. 

The conversations between the course instructor - Prof. Percy Dias, and the IS auditing practitioner will give you a concrete idea on how IS auditors perform their duties, the qualities to become IS auditors and future prospects of IS auditing industry.

This course is suitable for students and graduates from Information Systems, Information Technology and Computer Science, and IT practitioners who are interested to get into the IS auditing field. It is also a good starting point for learners who would like to pursue further studies for IS audit certifications – such as Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA).



## Module 1 Introduction to Information System (IS) Auditing

IS Auditing is related to risks, controls and assurance. In the first module, Prof. Dias introduces what risk is about. Getting deeper to risk, the 3-step risk management process is elaborated. To manage risks, controls need to be established. Prof. Dias also demonstrates with daily examples on what the controls are.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain why do businesses take risks
- Interpret three elements of risks
- Analyze typical IT-related risks by determining the threat, impact and possibilities
- List three major risk management processes
- Coduct risk assessment task based on a scenario
- Discuss three ways to mitigate risks and their pros and cons of each of the three ways
- Explain the major reasons of performing risk re-evaluation, and the frequency to perform the risk re-evaluation
- Express the definition and the primary use of internal controls
- Classify internal controls into three major categories
- Practice categorizing internal controls using different IT-related scenarios

## Module 2 Perform IS auditing


You may have heard of financial auditing, do you know the difference between IS auditing and financial auditing? You are going to explore more about IS auditing through the conversation between Prof. Dias and the IS audit practitioner. Prof. Dias then explains the general IS audit procedures and two major testings that IS auditors/compliance officers have to conduct. Prof. Dias also explains the procedure to obtain evidence in order to produce justified audit reports.

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss the situation where organizations need to set up the IS audit procedure
- Explain the three major categories of the general IS audit procedure
- Identify the major audit areas of the audit client, which IS auditors need to get prepared
- Identify the major audit subjects of the audit client
- Explain the basic steps involved in performing IS audit, from Planning to Reporting and Follow up
- Compare compliance testing and substantive testing
- Describe the situations IS auditors need to perform substantive testing
- Explain the purpose of obtaining evidence in IS auditing
- Discuss major ways to obtain evidence
- Interpret a typical technique of obtaining evidence - Re-performance
- Interpret a typical technique of obtaining evidence - Confirmation
- Explain the four determinants to evaluate the quality of the evidence

## Module 3 Business Application Development and the Roles of IS Auditors

IT practitioners develop business applications following the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). IS auditors are in place to ensure the controls are implemented to mitigate the risks of developing application systems throughout the SDLC. Prof. Dias is going to review what IT practitioners usually do, and further elaborate the role that IS auditors play in different phases of SDLC.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain the rationale of developing new applications
- Justify the most important phase in the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Review the role of IS auditors during different phases of SDLC
- Analyze different situations and suggest which of the three different kinds of testing should be applied during the development phase of SDLC
- Explain different input/output controls when during the system configuration to secure the information systems
- Recommend the best system changeover approach in terms of risks, cost and limitation
- Explain the importance of post-implementation review, how we should conduct it and who are the best parties to conduct
- Give examples of the risks of application development
