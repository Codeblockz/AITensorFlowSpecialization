## Module 1. Prepare a development environment and host a web application

Set up your development environment with several popular IDEs. Use Azure App Service to build and host web applications in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. Create a website through the hosted web app platform in Azure App Service.


- Azure deployment model is flexible, 
  - for example, 
    - you can develop in Visual Studio, 
    - commit your code to GitHub, 
    - build with Azure DevOps, and 
    - then deploy to Azure.

- Or you could use a different IDE integrated development environment
  - like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Develop on Linux and deploy directly from your development machine to the cloud.

## Module 2. Publish a web app to Azure with Visual Studio

Use the publishing features of Visual Studio 2019 to deploy and manage an ASP.NET Core web application hosted on Azure.

## Module 3. Stage and scale apps

Use deployment slots to streamline deployment and roll back a web app in Azure App Service without downtime or a service interruption. You also learn how to rapidly roll back a new deployment to the previous version if it causes problems. You'll use Azure App Service to scale a web app to match planned seasonal throughput requirements and also meet demand during short-term peak events incrementally increasing the resources available and then, to reduce costs, decreasing these resources when activity drops. This module also describes how to scale up a web app onto more powerful hardware to meet future requirements.

## Module 4. Organize resources in Microsoft Azure

See how web apps in Azure allow you to publish and manage your website easily without having to work with the underlying servers, storage, or network assets. Instead, you can focus on your website features and rely on the robust Azure platform to provide secure access to your site.

## Module 5. Course Practice Exam

In this module, you will take a practice exam that covers key skills measured in the Prepare for the Exam AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure. After completing this module, you will be able to:  1) Prepare for the Exam AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure.
