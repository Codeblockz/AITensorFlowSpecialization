Supplemental Reading: The Brief, Brief History of Blockchain
  In his article Here Comes the Epoch of Blockchain, Andrew Keys, Head of Business Development at ConsenSys, lays out the areas of our world that are centralized, why it causes issues, and how blockchain can be a catalyst for change. He emphasizes that the Ethereum blockchain gives users the ability to program interactions with other users - if you do this, I will give you this - opening up new possibilities for people from all over the world to interact with each other. The promise of blockchain that is beginning to be realized is that a blockchain can give anyone the opportunity to interact with anyone else, and not have to trust a central authority in the process. This is incredibly powerful.
