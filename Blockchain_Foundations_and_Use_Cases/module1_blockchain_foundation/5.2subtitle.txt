So, why blockchain? In my opinion, blockchains offer humanity, essentially the next generation of the database. Right now we're in a time period where customers of businesses, or citizens of governments essentially allocate their digital assets and their personal information to either those businesses or those governments. We create an adversarial environment whereby if I am a client in the business, I literally have to log into their turf and house all of our transactional and my personal data on their environment. In the future, we're essentially creating for the first time a mesh network of having the database and the Internet be one. We will be able to have multi-sided marketplaces, where instead of having to pay an intermediary provide trust we are now evolving to trusting software. I think there are two major distinguishing pieces of technology upgrade that we're dealing with. One is the ability to digitize assets. So, in the future we're going to have natively digital representations of assets. That means that we will have tokens that could signify fee out, stocks, bonds, derivatives, insurance policies, software licenses, credit card points, concert tickets. The other technology upgrade that we're going to have due to blockchains is the ability to have Smart Contracts, which are neither smart nor contracts but basically, they are software objects that facilitate the ability for human beings, and earth and businesses to essentially agree much easier. I believe that this will lead us to re-architect the way our legal, financial and social operating systems work.
