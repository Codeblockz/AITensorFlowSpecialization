Decentralization is fundamentally about shifting power and authority in a community away from one central entity and making that power available to the members themselves, making community members self-sovereign. A good example is BitTorrent. BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that doesn't rely on any one server, company, or entity to work. Bitcoin works in somewhat the same way in that it doesn't require a bank to act as a central arbiter between two people who want to exchange value. The protocol empowers them to do it themselves. Decentralization also has concrete tangible benefits for networked systems. For one, systems are less likely to fail if they rely on separated redundant components. They're harder to attack, and it's harder for malicious entities to exploit the system's users who may not all be gathered in one place. A blockchain with 100 nodes is highly resistant to attack because if, say, five nodes go down, the system can easily continue operating with the other 95 remaining nodes. Generally speaking, centralization of power can result in companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google finding ways to monetize user data and habits in ways that the users may not like and may not even know about. Users of popular free online services may think of themselves as the customer and the service that they're using the product. But that's actually backward. It's the users themselves and their information that is the product being sold. It's their data that is valuable. But if it's your data, why are other people profiting off of it? Another of the benefits of decentralization is that it can put that value back in the hands of the user. This is a significant shift in thinking about how systems can operate, and its potential impact is difficult to overstay. Decentralization gets us part of the way to understanding blockchain. Now let's take a look at ledgers.
