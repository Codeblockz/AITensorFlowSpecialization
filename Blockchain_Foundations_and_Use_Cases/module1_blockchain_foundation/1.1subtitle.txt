Welcome to the course. You made the decision to learn about blockchain at a very exciting time for the technology. In this course, we at ConsenSys Academy, want to introduce you to blockchain both philosophically and technically. Our goal is that by the end of this course, you'll be well-equipped to understand the basics of blockchain and where and how it can best be used. This industry is growing rapidly and many believe that blockchain is revolutionary. The advent of the Internet completely upended our world and in just decades changed everything about how we communicate. But, with the great many benefits, came some drawbacks and risks. Something we might call the "digitization gambit." We only gain the benefit by giving something up. Many of the things we attach value to are pure information, books, movies, software, but if it's possible to copy and transfer something infinitely and for free, how can we preserve value? In a digital world where anything is changeable, how can we establish trust, maintain truth and stay secure? Some of the great potential in blockchain is just that. It can allow us to create value, trust, and truth with a clever use of distributed ledgers, cryptography and computation. Blockchain networks open up the possibility of a decentralized world, where users of technology can be empowered without being beholden to third-party power brokers. But, that's just the beginning. Now, we'd like to start things off by telling you a bit about ConsenSys and why in taking our course, you're in good hands.
