ConsenSys is at the forefront of the blockchain industry, with a specific focus on Ethereum, which extends the technological possibilities of blockchain beyond simple transactions by providing a distributed computation platform called the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We'll get deeper into all that later in the course. ConsenSys is a fast-growing distributed start-up incubator, with talented blockchain developers all around the world. ConsenSys itself is organized by the same principles that guide distributed networks. Employees are structured in a mesh, rather than a hierarchy. Throughout that mesh, we have access to some of the greatest minds in the space, which is why we here at ConsenSys Academy are uniquely positioned to offer you some of the best training and information about blockchain available. In this course, we'll be taking a closer look at Ethereum because of the power it offers developers and the glimpses it can give to the future and potential of blockchain technology. If you're interested in our organization, we encourage you to reach out to us through our website at consensys.net. If you're thinking of becoming a developer in this space, checkout our separate developer program. That will get you up to speed and coding on the blockchain. With that, let's get this course started with a brief history of blockchain.
