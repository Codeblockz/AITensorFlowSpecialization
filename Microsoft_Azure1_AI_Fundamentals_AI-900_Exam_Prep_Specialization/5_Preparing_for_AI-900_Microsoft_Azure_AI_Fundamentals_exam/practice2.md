Question 1
## In a machine learning algorithm, what method should you use to split data for training and evaluation?

1 / 1 point

x Randomly split the data into rows for training and rows for evaluation


Use features for training and labels for evaluation


Use labels for training and features for evaluation


Randomly split the data into rows for training and columns for evaluation

Correct
In Azure Machine Learning, the percentage split is the available technique to split the data. In this technique, random data of a given percentage will be split to train and test data.
