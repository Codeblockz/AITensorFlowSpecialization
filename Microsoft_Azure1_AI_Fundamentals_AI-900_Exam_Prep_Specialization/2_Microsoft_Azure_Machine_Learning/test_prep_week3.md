Question 1
## Which metric presents the ratio of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) to the total number of predictions?

1 / 1 point

Precision


Recall


x Accuracy


F1 Score

Correct
Accuracy presents the ratio of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) to the total number of predictions.

2.
Question 2
## You use an Azure Machine Learning designer pipeline to train and test a binary classification model. You review the model's performance metrics in an Evaluate Model module, and note that it has an AUC score of 0.6. What can you conclude about the model?

1 / 1 point

x The model performs better than random guessing


The model can explain 60% of the variance between true and predicted labels.


The model predicts accurately for 40% of cases

Correct
The higher the score of AUC, the better the performance of the model.

3.
Question 3
## Which metric presents the fraction of positives cases correctly identified?

1 / 1 point

Accuracy


Recall


x Precision


F1 Score

Correct
Precision presents the fraction of positive cases correctly identified (the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives)

4.
Question 4
## Which of the following scenarios can be resolved by applying classification models?

1 / 1 point

A company who wants to predict the churn rate of their subscribers for next month.


x A toy company wanting to determine which clients are inclined to buy a specific toy.

Correct
Classification is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to.


x A bank wanting to determine if a specific set of clients are eligible for taking a loan.

Correct
Classification is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to.

Question 5
## Which of the following are models that help predict between two or several categories?

Select all that apply.

1 / 1 point

x Two-class decision forest

Correct
Two-class decision forests and Two-class logistic regressions help predict between two categories, while Multi-class neural networks help predict between several categories.


x Multi-class neural network 

Correct
Two-class decision forests and Two-class logistic regressions help predict between two categories, while Multi-class neural networks help predict between several categories.


Linear Regression


x Two-class logistic regression

Correct
Two-class decision forests and Two-class logistic regressions help predict between two categories, while Multi-class neural networks help predict between several categories.

Question 6
True or False?

## Classification is an example of a supervised machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.

1 / 1 point

x True


False

Correct
Classification is an example of a supervised machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.

7.
Question 7
## You are using Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a binary classification model.At some point, you want to separate the data into training and testing sets. Which model should you add to the pipeline?

1 / 1 point

Select columns in dataset


Join data 


x Split data 

Correct
Split data module is particularly useful when you need to separate data into training and testing sets.
