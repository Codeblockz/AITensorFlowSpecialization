## Machine learning is a technique that uses statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.

1 / 1 point

True 


x False 

Correct
Machine learning is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.

Question 2
## What model is best suited for predicting categories or classes?

1 / 1 point

x Classification 


Regression 


Time series forecasting 

Correct
Classification is best suited for predicting categories or classes.

Question 3
True or False?

## The “Predicted vs. True” chart shows a diagonal trend in which the predicted value correlates closely to the true value.

1 / 1 point

x True 


False

Correct
The “Predicted vs. True” chart should show a diagonal trend in which the predicted value correlates closely to the true value.

Question 4
## If you want to automatically pre-process the features before training, what setting should you use?

1 / 1 point

Training job time


x Enable featurization


Explain best model

Correct
Enable featurization causes Azure Machine Learning to automatically pre-process the features before training.

5.
Question 5
## In a residual histogram, what do residuals represent?

1 / 1 point

Variance between predicted and false values that cannot be explained by the model


Variance between predicted and false values that can be explained by the model


x Variance between predicted and true values that cannot be explained by the model

Correct
Residuals represent variance between predicted and true values that can't be explained by the model.
