Question 5
## You are building an Azure Machine learning pipeline that involves a clustering module. You need to prepare the data and change some of the numeric values from the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. 

Which module should you apply?

1 / 1 point

x Normalize Data


Edit metadata


Split data

Correct
The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.

Question 6
True or False?

## Clustering is an example of supervised machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics or features.

1 / 1 point

x False


True

Correct
Clustering is an example of unsupervised machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics or features.

Question 7
## A Hospital Care chain wants to open a series of Emergency-Care wards within a region. The chain knows the location of all the maximum accident-prone areas in the region. They have to decide the number of the Emergency Units to be opened and the location of these Emergency Units, so that all the accident-prone areas are covered in the vicinity of these Emergency Units. 

Which type of machine learning model is best to be applied in this scenario?

1 / 1 point

Classification


x Clustering


Regression 

Correct
Clustering models have the purpose of separating similar data points into intuitive groups. With clustering, the chain can group accidents by emergency units.
