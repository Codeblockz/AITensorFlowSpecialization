1 / 1 point

True 


x False 

Correct
Clustering is a form of machine learning that is used to group similar items into clusters based on their features.

2.
Question 2
##  What type of machine learning technique does clustering examples?

1 / 1 point

x Unsupervised 


Reinforcement 


Supervised
Correct
Clustering is an example of unsupervised machine learning.

3.
Question 3
## You create a machine learning experiment based on a clustering model. Now you want to use the model in an inference pipeline. Which module should you use to infer cluster predictions from the model?

1 / 1 point

x Assign data to clusters 


Score model


Train clustering model

Correct
Assign Data to Clusters module generates cluster predictions from a trained clustering model.

4.
Question 4
## When using a clustering module, what algorithm letâ€™s you group items into a number of clusters you specify?

1 / 1 point

x K-Means algorithm


B: L-Means algorithm


C-Means algorithm

Correct
The K-Means algorithm groups items into the number of clusters you specify.

5.
Question 5
## Suppose you are testing a K-Means clustering model. If you would want your model to assign items to one of four clusters, which parameter/property should you configure on the module?

1 / 1 point

x Set number of centroids to 4


Set stratified split


Set random seed to 4

Correct
The number of centroids defines the number of clusters.
