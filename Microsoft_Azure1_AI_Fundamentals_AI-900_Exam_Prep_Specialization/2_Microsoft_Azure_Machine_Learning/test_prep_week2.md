Question 2
True or False?

## After creating and running a pipeline to train the model, you need a second pipeline that performs the same data transformations for new data, and then uses the trained model to predict label values based on its features.

1 / 1 point

x True


False

Correct
An inference pipeline will form the basis for a predictive service that you can publish for applications to use.

3.

Question 4
## You are creating a training pipeline for a regression model and you want to make sure that the dataset is complete, otherwise you need to perform various operations to fix the data. Which module should you add to the pipeline?

1 / 1 point

Select columns in a dataset


x Clean missing data


Normalize data 

Correct
Clean missing data helps to check data for missing values and then perform various operations to fix the data or insert new values. The goal of such cleaning operations is to prevent problems caused by missing data that can arise when training a model.

5.
Question 5
## You are creating a training pipeline for a regression model and your dataset contains hundreds of columns. For a particular part of your model, you want to use data only from some specific columns. Which module should you add to the pipeline?

1 / 1 point

Clean missing data


Normalize data 


x Select columns in a dataset

Correct
This module is used to choose a subset of columns to use in downstream operations.

6.
Question 6
## Which of the following scenarios can be resolved by using a regression model?

1 / 1 point

x Predict yearly income of customers based on their occupation, age, education etc.

Correct
Regression is a form of machine learning that is used to predict a numeric label based on an item's features


x Predict daily rental demand of bicycles by using historic data.

Correct
Regression is a form of machine learning that is used to predict a numeric label based on an item's features


x Predict selling price of a car using data like engine size, mileage, number of seats etc.

Correct
Regression is a form of machine learning that is used to predict a numeric label based on an item's features


Determine if patients with some pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer from diabetes

7.
Question 7
## You created a machine learning model and trained it. Now you want to run the model to predict data. Which compute target should you use?

1 / 1 point

Compute Clusters 


x Inference Clusters 


Compute Instances

Correct
Inference Clusters are used as deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
