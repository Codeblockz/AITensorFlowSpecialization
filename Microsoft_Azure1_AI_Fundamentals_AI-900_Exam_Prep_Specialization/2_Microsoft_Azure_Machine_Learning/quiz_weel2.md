Question 1
True or False?

## Regression is a form of machine learning that is used to predict an item’s feature based on the numeric label. 

1 / 1 point

True 


x False 

Correct
Regression is a machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.

Question 2
## In order to use Azure Machine Learning, what should you create in your Azure subscription?

1 / 1 point

A SQL Server 


An App Service Plan 


x A Machine Learning Workspace 

Correct
You can use this workspace to manage data, compute resources, code, models, and other artifacts related to your machine learning workloads. 

App Service plans are used to host web apps. 

SQL Servers are used to host SQL databases and manage them.

Question 3
## Suppose you created a machine learning model and you want to train it. Which compute target should you use?

1 / 1 point

Inference Clusters 


x Compute Clusters 


Compute Instances. 

Correct
Compute Clusters are scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code. 

Compute Instances are development workstations that you can use to test your model.

Inference Clusters are used as deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.

Question 5
## You are planning on using Azure Machine Learning. From a payment plan perspective, what costs should you expect?

1 / 1 point

Monthly subscription


x Pay-for-what-you-use


One-time license

Correct
Azure Machine Learning enables the use of cloud-based compute resources that scale effectively to handle large volumes of data. With this cloud-based service you only pay for the Azure Machine Learning resources that you use.
