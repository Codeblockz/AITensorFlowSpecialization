Question 2
## You use Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a classification model. What must you do before deploying the model as a service?

1 / 1 point

Clone the training pipeline with a different name 


x Create an inference pipeline from the training pipeline


Add an Evaluate Model module to the training pipeline 

Correct
An inference pipeline must be created in order to deploy as a service.

Question 3
## A health clinic is planning on using datasets that contain characteristics of patients to predict whether the patient has a risk of diabetes or not. Can this task be accomplished with the help of classification?

1 / 1 point

x Yes 


No 

Correct
In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.
