## About this Course

Whether you're just beginning to work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) or you already have AI experience and are new to Microsoft Azure, this course provides you with everything you need to get started. Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowers amazing new solutions and experiences; and Microsoft Azure provides easy to use services to help you build solutions that seemed like science fiction a short time ago; enabling incredible advances in health care, financial management, environmental protection, and other areas to make a better world for everyone.

In this course, you will learn the key AI concepts of machine learning, anomaly detection, computer vision, natural language processing, and conversational AI. Youâ€™ll see some of the ways that AI can be used and explore the principles of responsible AI that can help you understand some of the challenges facing developers as they try to create ethical AI solutions. 

This course will help you prepare for Exam AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals. This is the first course in a five-course program that prepares you to take the AI-900 certification exam. This course teaches you the core concepts and skills that are assessed in the AI fundamentals exam domains.  This beginner course is suitable for IT personnel who are just beginning to work with Microsoft Azure and want to learn about Microsoft Azure offerings and get hands-on experience with the product. Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate or Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate, but it is not a prerequisite for any of them.

This course is intended for candidates with both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience is not required; however, some general programming knowledge or experience would be beneficial.  To be successful in this course, you need to have basic computer literacy and proficiency in the English language. You should be familiar with basic computing concepts and terminology,  general technology concepts, including concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN

- Identify guiding principles for responsible AI

## Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations

In this module, you will see how Artificial Intelligence enables the creation of powerful solutions to many kinds of problems. AI systems can exhibit human characteristics to analyze the world around them, make predictions or inferences, and act on them in ways that we could only imagine a short time ago.

You will also see how with this power, comes responsibility. As developers of AI solutions, we must apply principles that ensure that everyone benefits from AI without disadvantaging any individual or section of society.
