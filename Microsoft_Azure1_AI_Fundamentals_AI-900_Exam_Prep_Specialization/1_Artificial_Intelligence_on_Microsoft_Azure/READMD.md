## Part 2 AI

### 2.1. AI

### Goal
- identify features of prediction or forecasting workloads, 
- identify features of anomaly detection workloads, 
- identify computer vision workloads, 
- identify natural language processing or knowledge mining workloads and 
- identify conversational AI workloads.

### What is AI

what is AI? Simply put AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. 

AI enables us to build amazing software that can improve health care, enable people to overcome physical disadvantages, empower smart infrastructure, create incredible entertainment experiences and even save the planet.

### 2.2. The features of machine learning

the key elements of AI. 
- First, **machine learning**. This is often the foundation for an AI system and is the way we teach a computer model to make predictions and to draw conclusions from data. 
- Second, **anomaly detection**. This is the capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system. 
- Third, **computer vision**. This is an area of AI in which software systems are designed to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images. 
- Fourth, **natural language processing** enables a computer to interpret written or spoken language and respond in kind, and finally, 
- **conversational AI**. Most commonly, conversational AI solutions use a software agent or bot to participate in conversation

### 2.3. Anomaly Detection

Examples:
- to monitor credit card transactions and detect unusual usage patterns that might indicate fraud. 
- an application that tracks activity in an automated production line and identifies failures. 
- a racing car telemetry system that uses sensors to proactively worn engineers about potential mechanical failures before they happen.

### 2.4. Computer Vision

Scenarios:
- Image classification
  - classify images into categories
- Object detection
  - identify the location of different classes of vehicles
- Semantic Segmentation
  - Classify individual pixels in an image
- Image analysis
  - Combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques
- Face detection
  - Analysis
  - Recognition 
- OCR Optical Character Recognition
  - Used to detect and read text in images
- Form processing
  - Read and save information from standard documents (e.g. PDF)


Services
- Azure Computer Vision Service 
- - to analyze images in video and extract descriptions, tags, objects and text. 
- Custom Vision Service 
- - to train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images. 
- Face service
- - to build face detection and facial recognition solutions, you can use the 
- Form recognizer
- - to extract information from scanned forms and invoices.


### 2.5. NLP

NLP can
- analyze and interpret
- interpret and synthesize 
- automatically translate
- interpret commands

Azure services
- Text analytics
- Translator text
- Speech
- LUIS 
  - language understanding, intelligence service or LUIS to train a language model that can understand spoken or text based command.

## Part 3: Guiding Principles for Responsible AI

### 3.1 Responsible AI

AI software development is guided by a set of **six principles**: 
- fairness, 
  - AI systems should treat all people fairly.
    - Microsoft Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction. This capability helps data scientists and developers identify and mitigate bias in the model. 
- reliability and safety, 
  - AI systems should perform reliably and safely
    - autonomous vehicle
    - diagnoses patients symptoms and recommends prescriptions
- privacy and security, 
  -  AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
     -  rely on large volumes of data,
- inclusiveness, 
  -  should empower everyone and engage people.
- transparency, and 
  - AI systems should be understandable. 
    - Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected
- accountability.
  - people should be accountable for AI systems
