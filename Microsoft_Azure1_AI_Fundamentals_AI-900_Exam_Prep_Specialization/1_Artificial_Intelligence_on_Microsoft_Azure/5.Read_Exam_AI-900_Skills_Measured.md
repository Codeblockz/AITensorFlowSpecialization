# Exam AI-900: Skills Measured
This exam was updated on January 27, 2021. 

# Audience Profile 

Candidates for this exam should have a foundational knowledge of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and related Microsoft Azure services. This exam is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of common ML and AI workloads and how to implement them on Azure.  This exam is intended for candidates with both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience is not required; however, some general programming knowledge or experience would be beneficial. Azure AI Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Data Scientist Associate or Azure AI Engineer Associate, but it is not a prerequisite for any of them. 

# Skills Measured 

NOTE: The bullets that appear below each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill. This list is not definitive or exhaustive. 

NOTE: Most questions cover features that are General Availability (GA). The exam may contain questions on Preview features if those features are commonly used.
