Select two options.

1 / 1 point

x A key

Correct
To use Computer Vision, you need the endpoint and the key of the service.


A connection string


x An endpoint

Correct

Question 3
## You want to build a solution that needs to detect images that contain adult content or depict violent, gory scenes. Which service would you use to achieve the task?

1 / 1 point

Custom Vision


A combination of both services


x Computer Vision

Correct
Computer vision offers the capability to moderate content.

4.
Question 4
True or False?

## To use the image classification capability with Custom Vision, you just have to deploy the service and then start generating predictions.

1 / 1 point

True


x False

Correct
Creating an image classification solution with Custom Vision consists of two main tasks. First, you must use existing images to **train** the model, and then you must publish the model so that client applications can use it to generate predictions.

5.
Question 5
## You plan on creating a solution that will scan a gallery of photos for images that contain product placement. Which capability of Computer Vision should you use?

1 / 1 point

Detect domain-specific content


Categorize an image


x Detect brands

Correct
The detect brands capability can help in identifying brands, and works well for product placement.

6.
Question 6
## You want to use the Computer Vision service with images where the dominant foreground color is red. Which of the following capabilities should you use?

1 / 1 point

Optical character recognition


Detect image types


x Detect image color schemes

Correct
Detect image color schemes capability can identify the dominant foreground, background, and overall colors in an image.

7.
Question 7
True or False?

## To train a classification model, you must upload images to your training resource and label them with the appropriate class labels.

1 / 1 point

x True 


False

Correct
To train a classification model, you must upload images to your training resource and label them with the appropriate class labels.

8.
Question 8
## You are training your image classification model and you realize that some images are not classified correctly. What should you do to improve the model?

1 / 1 point

Add new labels to the model 


x Add additional images to the training set


C: Reduce the number of images used for the training set

Correct
The more images in the training set, the better the model will understand patterns and the more accurate its predictions will be.

9.
Question 9
## You are creating a solution that needs to identify if celebrities are present in images and also to determine their age. What capabilities should you take into account?

Select all options that apply.

1 / 1 point

Categorize an image


x Detect domain-specific content

Correct
You can detect celebrities with the detect domain-specific content feature, while the age can be determined by the detect faces feature.


x Detect faces 

Correct
You can detect celebrities with the detect domain-specific content feature, while the age can be determined by the detect faces feature.

10.
Question 10
## You are creating a solution that needs to extract handwritten text from several image scans. Which Computer Vision capability should you use?

1 / 1 point

Describe an image


Detect domain-specific content


x Optical character recognition

Correct
The Computer Vision service can use optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities to detect printed and handwritten text in images.
