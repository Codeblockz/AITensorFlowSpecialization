Question 2
## Which of the following scenarios are suitable use cases for image classification?

Select all options that apply.

1 / 1 point

x Evaluating images from X-ray or MRI devices could quickly classify specific issues

Correct
Classification is a machine learning technique that you can use to predict which category, or class, something belongs to.


x Evaluating key infrastructure for major disaster preparation efforts 

Correct
Classification is a machine learning technique that you can use to predict which category, or class, something belongs to.


x Identifying specific products in online searches

Correct
Classification is a machine learning technique that you can use to predict which category, or class, something belongs to.

Question 3
## When you create a Custom Vision resource and access it for the first time, which options do you have available as configuration for the resource?

Select all options that apply.

1 / 1 point

x Prediction option only

Correct
All three options are available as configuration. You can either choose to use your service for training, for predictions, or for doing both activities.


x Training option only

Correct
All three options are available as configurations. You can either choose to use your service for training, for predictions, or for doing both.


x Both training and prediction options

Correct
All three options are available as configuration. You can either choose to use your service for training, for predictions, or doing both activities.

Question 4
True or False?

## The simplest approach is to use a general Cognitive Services resource for both training and prediction. This means you only need to concern yourself with one endpoint and one key.

1 / 1 point

x True


False

Correct
Creating a Cognitive Service for both training and prediction activities simplifies the management of endpoints and keys.

5.
Question 5
## You are using Custom Vision and you want to evaluate the performance of your trained model. Which metric indicates the percentage of the correct class predictions?

1 / 1 point

Average precision (AP)


x Precision


Recall

Correct
Precision metrics indicate what percentage of the class predictions made by the model were correct.
