Question 1
## You have built a solution that detects objects in images. You are using the same endpoint and key to predict as you usedwhen you trained the model. What type of service are you using?

1 / 1 point

Custom Vision


x Cognitive Service


Computer Vision

Correct
The simplest approach is to use a general Cognitive Services resource for both training and prediction.

2.
Question 2
## You plan on using object detection. After you have trained your model, you want to assess the performance of the model. Which performance metrics are available for you to analyze?

Select all options that apply.

1 / 1 point

x Precision

Correct
At the end of the training process, the performance for the trained model is indicated by the following evaluation metrics: precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).


Project ID


x Recall

Correct
At the end of the training process, the performance for the trained model is indicated by the following evaluation metrics: precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).


x Mean average precision

Correct
At the end of the training process, the performance for the trained model is indicated by the following evaluation metrics: precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).

3.
Question 3
 
## You created a solution the makes use of object detection. You deployed two separate resources in Azure â€“ one that manages the training of the model, and one that manages the predictions. To which endpoint should you make calls to generate predictions?

1 / 1 point

Training endpoint


Any endpoint (prediction or training), both will work


x Prediction endpoint

Correct
To generate predictions, it must be used the HTTP address of the endpoint for the prediction resource to which you published the model.

4.
Question 4
True or False?

## Object detection is a form of machine learning-based computer vision in which a model is trained to recognize individual types of objects in an image, and to identify their location in the image.

1 / 1 point

x True


False

Correct
Object detection is a form of machine learning-based computer vision in which a model is trained to recognize individual types of objects in an image, and to identify their location in the image.

5.
Question 5
## Which of the following application examples are a good fit to use object detection?

Select all options that apply.

1 / 1 point

x Creating software for self-driving cars or vehicles with lane assist capabilities

Correct
Object detection can be used in many scenarios, all scenarios listed being a good fit.


x Evaluating the safety of a building by looking for fire extinguishers or other emergency equipment

Correct
Object detection can be used in many scenarios, all scenarios listed being a good fit.


Determining the color of clothes


x Medical imaging such as an MRI or x-rays that can detect known objects for medical diagnosis

Correct
Object detection can be used in many scenarios, all scenarios listed being a good fit.

6.
Question 6
## You are using the object detection capability toevaluate the performance metrics of the trained model. You observe that the recall metric has a value of 0.7. What does this mean?

1 / 1 point

x The model identified the class in 70% of the images


The model identified the class in 30% of the images


The model predicted correctly 70% of the images

Correct
Recall metric specifies what percentage of the class predictions made by the model were correct.

7.
Question 7
## What key considerations should you make when tagging training images for object detection?

1 / 1 point

Repeating the same images in the training set


x Having images of the objects in question for multiple angles

Correct
Key considerations when tagging training images for object detection are ensuring that you have sufficient images of the objects in question, preferably from multiple angles; and making sure that the bounding boxes are defined tightly around each object.


x Ensuring sufficient images of the objects in question
