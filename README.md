# AI-TensorFlow-Blockchain-Certificate
My notes for coursera course for AI,TensorFlow, Blockchain and the certificates I earned.


## 1. [AI TensorFlow Specialization](./AI_Tensorflow_in_Practice_Specialization) by DeepLearning.AI

This is a very good "Introduction to AI/ML" level course. And I think it is friendly to everyone, including 
those who don't have any background. The workload is not high. You can finish this quickly (<= 7 days) and obtain basic 
understanding of AI/ML and how to code them!

It consists of 4 courses:
- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
- Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

## 2. [Blockchain: Foundations and Use Cases (Use Ethereum)](Blockchain_Foundations_and_Use_Cases/module1_blockchain_foundation) by ConsenSys Academy

This is a good introduction course to blockchain. But it's worth to mention that it focus more on public blockchain/permissionless blockchain. It uses Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples in most cases. 

The first two modules talk about public blockchain. Module 3 mentions the public/private/consortium blockchains. The private blockchain in module 3 is old (It looks it's before 2019). It says only on organization and the access control is cnetralized, which is not true in 2022. For example, Hyperledge Fabric supports multiple organizations to establish a private blockchain.

It consists of 5 parts:
- [Module 1 Blockchain Foundations](module1_blockchain_foundation/Module1.md) 
- - Lesson 1 Introduction
- - Lesson 2 The Brief, Brief History of Blockchain
- - Lesson 3: What is Decentralization?
- - Lesson 4: Ledgers, Distributed Ledgers, and Consensus
- - Lesson 5: The Paper Blockchain
- [Module 2 The Technical Side](module2_tech_side/module2.md)
- - Lesson 1: Public Key Cryptography
- - Lesson 2: Cryptographic Hash Functions
- - Lesson 3: Public Key Cryptography & Signing
- - Lesson 4: Anatomy of a Block
- - Lesson 5: The Chain of Blocks
- - Lesson 6: Nodes and Networks
- [Module 3 Blockchain In Use](module3_blockchain_in_use/module3.md)
- - Lesson 1: Consensus Mechanisms and Trust Frameworks
- - Lesson 2: Public, Private & Consortium Blockchains
- - Lesson 3: When to Use a Blockchain
- - Lesson 4: Implications of Blockchain on Business
