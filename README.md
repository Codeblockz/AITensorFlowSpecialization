# AI-TensorFlow-Blockchain-Certificate
My notes for coursera course for AI,TensorFlow, Blockchain and the certificates I earned.


# 1. [AI TensorFlow Specialization](./AI_Tensorflow_in_Practice_Specialization) by DeepLearning.AI

This is a very good "Introduction to AI/ML" level course. And I think it is friendly to everyone, including 
those who don't have any background. The workload is not high. You can finish this quickly (<= 7 days) and obtain basic 
understanding of AI/ML and how to code them!

It consists of 4 courses:
- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
- Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

# 2. [Blockchain: Foundations and Use Cases (Use Ethereum)](Blockchain_Foundations_and_Use_Cases) by ConsenSys Academy

This is a good introduction course to blockchain. But it's worth to mention that it focus more on public blockchain/permissionless blockchain. It uses Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples in most cases. 

- Permissionless / Public blockchain
- Permissioned 
- - consortium blockchain
- - private blockchain

The first two modules talk about public blockchain. Module 3 mentions the public/private/consortium blockchains. Module 4 explain more detials, mainly focus on detials of Etereum.
