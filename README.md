# AI-TensorFlow-Blockchain-Certificate
My notes for coursera course for AI,TensorFlow, Blockchain and the certificates I earned.


1. AI TensorFlow Specialization

This is a very good "Introduction to AI/ML" level course. And I think it is friendly to everyone, including 
those who don't have any background. The workload is not high. You can finish this quickly (<= 7 days) and obtain basic 
understanding of AI/ML and how to code them!

It consists of 4 courses:
- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
- Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
